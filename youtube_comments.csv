"0:00- ""We all know why we are here."" To watch a video and leave a 'long comment' for good ol' Jack who always keeps me company after work? You beat me to it again. I have a copy of this game and want to play it, but then video(s). No matter, I can play this later on.
0:43- ""As a cat owner myself now, I am incredibly attached to this game."" I had a feeling that Gab would play this. Wasn't sure if you would or not. Does BB like watching either of you play Stray? I have read that some people's cats are quite curious about this game.
1:21- You smooshing all over the cats realistic behavior is so cute. :)
2:52- Barely 3ish minutes in and I am very impressed with the visuals and music/sound. Can't wait to see what they did with the story and gameplay mechanics.
6:32- ""When all of humanity dies, cats will outlive us all."" I always thought that it would be cockroaches. Those nasty bugs are basically indestructible.
9:37- ""Oh my God, my heart is breaking in half."" :( Little Red needs you to help them find their family- keep going.
14:12- ""I got a bucket, Baby!"" (narrator voice) Little Red now has a bucket. It is shiny and just the proper size. Little Red will now never be lonely again, and may find some new DLC.
16:33- ""Do you think if I left the cat long enough he would just sit down?"" Probably, or take a nap.
19:14- ""Don't they kind of look like headcrabs?"" Yeah, and it is gross! They also look like tardigrades to me.
24:17- ""The past couple of days, even the past week, I have been feeling a little miserable."" :( I hope that it goes better for you soon. Count all of the little things before bed- it helps. (tasty hot food, a call from your bestie, nice bath, ect.)
30:08- ""Wait, I don't actually see another one."" The PC in the middle of the room has one on its tower.
47:01- ""Hear that Everybody? We are the Soft Ones."" Compared to them, we are. These beings seem like leftover human consciousness put into robot form. They don't seem like usual robots to me. Maybe humans were dying and made these beings to live on in a new form?
54:48- ""I am so turned around, I don't know where I have been, it is kind of confusing."" You will get it eventually. Shame that this game doesn't have a mini-map or something.
1:01:02- ""But as a Gamer, I never will. I am stuck inside."" That's no good! Even a walk around the block helps now and then. Maybe when it isn't 40C out, right?
1:08:24- ""What does B-12 help against?"" Vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) plays an essential role in red blood cell formation, cell metabolism, nerve function, and the production of DNA.
1:15:50- ""It was only 1 that I needed, right?"" At the moment.

"today my older neighbor across from me almost had heat stroke, again.  she ended out getting stuck in tulsa when her suv stopped working, which it was around 110F degrees (about 43C) but realfeel made it feel 10 degrees hotter than that due to the humidity and by the time she finally made it home, she was on the verge of heat stroke.  i got her a cold bottle of water and walked her dog for her while she sipped the water.  she has been having issues with the ac unit, so we turned on her little portable fan to help cool her off since she wasn't strong enough to go get into a cold bath.  i sat with her for a little bit to make sure she was okay.  she told me she had heat stroke 3 times before this, so she knew the symptoms and how to deal with it.  and even though i was nervous about leaving her alone, she told me that she would be okay and to come back in three hours.  and said that if she didn't answer my knock or ringing the doorbell, to go to her bedroom window and knock and then if she still didn't answer, to go get the maintenance lady to open her door for me because we wanted to make sure she was okay first instead of calling for an ambulance for a false alarm, you know?  she has no issue with having to go to the hospital, but it comes down to cost and stuff because she would still be charged for the ambulance coming out and it being a false alarm.  i checked on her three hours later and to also walk her dog again.  she was still rather nauseous, but better, and i had given her small bottles of apple and grape juice that i had, since i read that fruit juice also helped those with heat exhaustion/stroke and she felt like she wouldn't be able to eat anything without getting sick.  and then checked on her a couple hours after that and again to walk her dog for the last time tonight and she said she was feeling a lot better.  she plans on heading right to bed and said if she needs me that she'll call or text my phone.

ever since her accident a couple months ago where she was literally hit by a car, i've been checking up on her more often than before.  the doctors told her that they were surprised she was even alive with how bad it was.  i'm the only one that cares enough to check on her and she also has three grandkids she raises. everyone else either lives too far, or literally could care less about her, including her own daughter.  the grandkids are currently visiting other family, so she is alone at the moment and that worries me more.  she's able to get around better than when she first came back from the hospital, but she is still recovering from broken hip and broken shoulder.  even my 14 yr old son has been helping me take care of her and helping walk the dog for her.  i kept telling her that she doesn't need to be out in this heat, especially with no ac in her car/suv, but she's stubborn and hates asking for help, which i understand, i'm the same way, but still.  i wish i had a license, and/or a car so that i could take her where she needs to go, or at least give her something with ac, but if i were to get a car, i'd be stuck living in it because it'd cost more than my rent at the moment.",0.0

The only time I heard about Stray was like a year or more ago when my sibling mentioned it, and over time I just forgot about it. Since I hadn't seen anything about it during development, I didn't know there were robots or anything, so it's all very unexpected for me but also absolutely incredible! I can't wait to see how the story plays out.",0.0

"I get what you're saying about cats always aiming forever for bigger jumps and how that's not that way in game. But you gotta think how these cats have been living out in the wild like that for who knows how many generations. They don't gotta aim any more. Their instincts are permanently sharp. They don't spend most of their days in a house where everything is super safe and there are maybe a total of two tall jumps. So I think considering that, the quickness of the big jumps in the game is accurate 😁",0.0

"Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It's also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells. Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes unbind vitamin B12 into its free form.

Also, I was surprised at how pretty and detailed the game is. Maybe it's because some games lately have been less than ideal in terms of graphics.

"45 minutes in and here's my lore guess. Some disease that only affects humans or everything except cats infected the Earth. Humans tried to stop it by making the cities with big walls and possibly ceilings but it got in anyways. Human's last ditch effort to survive the disease was transferring their consciousness into robots hence the ""I hope this works""  and how all the robots act and dress like humans.  Part of me wants to think that the robots are scared of the cat because the cats can carry the disease, But that wouldn't make sense because why would the robots be susceptible to it and The Guardian said something about not seeing your kind before. Maybe the place at the start is where all the cats are and you're the only cat to come down?  B12 seemed to at least know you were a cat while The Guardian didn't know what you are. Perhaps the robots are just generally scared of things they don't understand, Which would make sense because of the ""as long as you don't eat anyone""  Implying something that kind of looked like a cat had eaten at least one robot.  I also would kind of think that by how B12 spoke about the backpack?  They didn't say it was for cats they said it was  Quadrupeds,  So maybe there's like dogs or some other 4 legged creature that's much more aggressive to robots?🤔🤔 I'm assuming that you'd have to be a similar size or that the backpack is Adjustable?  I guess considering how  B12 can like dematerialize objects or something I guess it would make more sense that the backpack is adjustable.  Anyways this game has cool world building I'm excited to see how it goes.",0.0

Blood results just came back (did them cuz he's 10/11, so like a lil older). Kidney disease? No.

Literally my cat was fine except for his electrolytes. Tiger went to the vet because he didn't drink enough water, and throwing up didn't help. $400 down the drain cuz he's a silly cat.🤦‍♀

From the knitting of the poncho, to the bag on the cat, and so on. Yes, they nailed the behavior of the cat, but as a person with ADHD, I think it’s also good for people who also have it to play Stray. I dunno, I’m just rambling. The point is, it’s nice to see Jack playing this and having so much fun with it, as he himself has ADHD.",0.0

It'd be a neat detail if the reason we can read the language written on things is because obviously the cat can't read. But some things are in English so that's not the case.

"I'm fairly certain the group of cats are littermates. Basically what it sounds like; siblings from the same litter. They play and bond just like the ones you get separated from, which is why it can be beneficial to adopt a pair from the same litter so they always have each other in a new place. However the same can be said if they get separated and isolated; they get sad and lonely (hence why owners need to give them extra attention to fix that). So the goal to get the kitty back with his/her pals makes sense, as a littermate will likely go out of their way to get reunited if they are bonded well enough.",0.0

"Jack talking about it being a post apocalyptic world with cats reminded me of a show: 

There’s a show Love, Death, and Robots on Netflix and one episode shows the world after humanity died out and robots are trying to figure out what happened. They decide humans were stupid but they also saw one rocket making it all the way out of earth and thought that maybe there’s hope for humans after all. 

Then it jumps to a space colony with a guy in a spacesuit. The guy turns around and takes off his helmet to show he is not a person, but a cat. The joke I remember was “Who did you expect? Elon Musk.”

So they had a similar idea of how cats will surpass us in every way and I found that funny.",0.0

"Heaven & hell are the only 2 places you will go to for eternity:
Heaven is a place of everlasting peace, love, joy, & happiness.
Hell is a place of eternal punishment, torment, weeping, & gnashing of teeth!
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL!
But here's how you can obtain your salvation:
Do you know Jesus Christ?
A Believe in your heart that Jesus suffered a brutal crucifixion, died on the cross, & rose again on the 3rd day 
B Confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord & admit that your a sinner: Lord, have pity & mercy on me, a sinner!
C Get water baptized & build a personal relationship with the holy spirit 
D Turn from your wicked ways & sin no more 
E Worship God in spirit & in truth & go 100% all in for the kingdom of God 
F Lay everything down to go follow Jesus 
Get to know exactly who Jesus is & what he did in the new testament of the holy Bible!
All of heaven rejoices over 1 sinner who repents!

Salvation is free, but
Salvation costs everything!",0.0

Lets take Germany for example where I live. Ok, our prices already include 19% of taxes but still the new base MacBook Air is 1499€(!), bump it up to what MKBHD got here it‘s 1849€ (!).

As the MBP has been around a while the 14“ rn starts around 1949€.

Why in the world should I even consider getting the new Air with prices like that? No idea what Apple was thinking but unless it‘s not at least 200-300€ cheaper no way. I rather get the M1 Air or if Windows is an option there‘s so many good ultrabooks around 1200€ which is still 300€ less than the crippled M2 Air.
I absolutely don‘t get these prices, they are not only not competitive in any means but doing the conversion I also feel massively ripped off by Apple in Europe.",0.0

"The ""problem"" for the MBA is that it punches above it's weight class since Apple put in their own chips.  We now want to use it for EVERYTHING, like video and photo editing, coding, and running VMs.  The fact it can is incredible (even though it is Apple's entry level laptop).  So we want to upgrade it to make those higher-end tasks run better and that's where we run into trouble.  It's pricey and the 14"" MBP has already set the price-point for higher level performance and features.  There is a narrow band for where the MBA makes sense if you want to push it. So the real answer is probably that the Air is for light users and the Pros are for everyone else.  Isn't that what Apple intended in the first place?",0.0

"It's a full 300 euros of a difference between the M1 Air in Europe so that's a 300 dollar difference which makes it an even harder sell, especially with the downgrade in SSD speeds. I waited for this but decided to get the 16 inch instead. It's not worth the price, especially if you upgrade to the 16gb ram and  512gb, the 14 inch is much better value. I saw both in the store and the 14 inch and the M2 display quality is a night and day difference, even just looking at the quality of the dock. The M2 Air display resolution and PPI is exactly the same as the first retina display from 2012 which is nuts for what you're paying. When it's standing beside the Pro Macbooks you see just how outdated the M2 Air display is by  2022 standards. You're going from one of the most outdated displays on the  market to the best display on the market jumping to the 14 inch. The M2 Macbook Air is a really bad buy for what you're getting for your money. You're really just paying hundreds more for a new design.",0.0

"One thing to consider on the comparisons to 14"" MBP: MBA is way nicer computer to use. Yes, MBP is truly great and runs rings around MBA when it comes to specs and performance. But it's also very substantial computer. It's pretty big, with substantial weight. It's not a device you just grab with you when heading out. It's not a device you really could carry in a backpack wherever you go. MBA is that computer.

My personal computer is the baseline M1 MBA. I also have a work-issued 14"" MBP with M1 Max CPU. Basically at the opposite ends of performance and capabilities when it comes to MacBooks. Both computers are available for me to use, and the one I choose to use for everyday things, is the MBA.

So when you spec up the MBA, you will start entering MBP territory on pricing. And the MBP is way more capable device. But being just such a nice device to use is also worth something.",0.0

"I’m seriously considering this laptop and had already resigned myself to the fact that it would be more like £1,500 rather than £1,200. However, I was thinking the increase would come from the need to bump the RAM up from 8GB to 16GB to future proof myself a little more. Is the slower SSD really that much of an issue that it is recommended to leave the RAM where it is and pop in the 512GB SSD? Is 8GB of RAM perfectly sufficient? I would mainly be using it for document writing and web browsing/research. Any advice/further clarity on how best to future proof this laptop to have the most headroom for these kinds of tasks in the coming years would be really greatly appreciated. 😊",0.0

"Hi all, answer each of the following questions separately at first: Question 1) do you think it is too much to spend $1,349 (student pricing - $150 gift card) for a M2 Macbook Air with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD?   Question 2) How about if I could get the entry level 14"" M1 Macbook Pro with 16 GB RAM and 512GB SSD for $1,719 (just $370 more than the M2 Air).  Question 3) Considering that the future M2 14"" Macbook Pro is probably just 6-9 months away, should I just wait and get the new to come M2 14"" Macbook Pro for the same $1,719? and Final Question 4) Since all I want to do with a macbook is to learn to code Xcode, should I just get the entry level M1 Macbook Air with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD for $749? (that's $600 less than the M2 Macbook Air, $970 less than the M1 14"" Macbook Pro.  The only reason I want the 16 GB RAM/512GB SSD M2 Air is because of the M2's slow SSD - otherwise, if the SSD was as fast as the M1 Air, then I would get the 8GB RAM /256gb SSD M2 Air.   But since the M2 Air SSD is so slow, I have to get the 512GB SSD with 16GB RAM).  To sum up:  what would you buy or not buy yet: (1) a M1 Air w 8GB RAM/256GB SSD for $749, (2) a M2 Air w 16GB RAM/512GB SSD for $1,349, (3) a M1 14"" Macbook Pro w 16GB RAM/512GB SSD for $1,719, or (4) wait 6 to 9 months for the new to come M2 14"" Macbook Pro that will probably come out at the same price as the current M1 14"" Macbook Pro?",0.0

First, there is no compelling reason for a computer so thin as a Fruitbook Air.   I know modern snowflakes like Brownlee are weak and whine when they have to carry an extra ounce of anything (but don't mind carrying a pound of dongles).    The Fruit company knows that there is a segment of the population who will buy a Fruitbook Air instead of a real laptop and hence you get this one with a new color and a host of bait and switch performance snafus.    A real company that gave a damn about its products would just offer Fruitbooks with fans and then start from there.   But thin is in and lazy and weak fools like Brownlee will swoon for the con job.

And so yes, while the 14 inch MBP does have a better display, etc etc as you mentioned, the main problem lies in the lack of fans, which you did mention in the beginning interestingly, which is why no one would (or at least shouldn’t) even consider the Air for sustained workflows, regardless of whether they max out the RAM and storage. Great vid nonetheless.",0.0
I think it's the only M2 review that hit the nail in the head.  M2 should thought of as £1.5k device rather than £1k like M1 that's 50% (!!!) more expensive than M1. Makes little sense at the moment with 14 Pro almost the same price but no doubts apple will hike the price of M2 14 Pro so that M2 looks like a bargain. Greed doesn't know limits.,0.0

"The MacBook Pro 14"" is nice and obviously the better choice if you *really* need this kind of power on a mobile device. However, it's significantly thicker and you'll surely notice the weight difference if you have to carry it constantly. My old 16"" MBP became very annoying, very quickly exactly because of the heavy weight (compared to the MBA).

The M2 MacBook Air is a nice device which easily gives one a great laptop experience for >5 years. Considering this none of the available Windows machines can compete to the package the MacBook Air (also the M2) provided considering the investment costs.

Too bad the Midnight color seems to be really that annoying and making it look dirty, it's therefore a No-Go for me. The 256GB issue is bad on Apple and deserves all the bad press and shame while it won't affect me personally. In my opinion the 256GB are way too tight nowadays, despite cloud storage. People who're price sensitive see this more negatively, I get and understand that.",0.0

The M2 air is a beautiful machine, but I don’t get it. The base model with 256GB/8GB is a joke for the price. With better specs it gets very expensive, even way more expensive in many other countries. So you’re either buying an outdated 1200 dollar laptop for browsing the web, or spending close to 2000 dollars (more than that abroad) for a decent MacBook Air. And if it could run all the software I wanted, I might consider it. But with an ‘ecosystem’ this limited and more closed than ever, I just can’t do it. Shame, because the ARM-based chips have so much potential. I’ll just get a Ryzen 6800u ultrabook instead, with a nice touchscreen and all the extra versatility.",0.0

"I must say, I've been using the MB Air M1 256gb model since December 2021 now as my daily device for regular stuff you do when studying. My girlfriend on the other side is using the Asus Zephyrus ROG 14"" from 2020 also for studying and sometimes for gaming. So I had two devices to test that couldn't be more different. In terms of battery-life the M1 just kills the Zephyrus. The M1 MB Air is just such a great device if using for these daily-driver-things. 
On the other side you got a huge handicap if you want to use this thing for gaming. The Zephyrus can still run most games without any problems, but It gets really loud really quick.
So if you are searching a device only for basic stuff like studying, YouTube, or anything like that the MB Air M1 even with 256gb is unbeatable in terms of price and battery. I never had any issues with it.
If you want to play some games be sure to spend some more money then a 1000 bucks (at least if you're living in Europe....).  And if you want to play games, maybe spend some money on a self made Pc and buy an older iPad Pro 10.5"" for traveling. But these are just my thoughts. :)

Upgrade the RAM and SSD to 16GB and 512GB (minimum in 2022 I believe) the price will go up to 160K INR ($2000). We can get a comparable Windows laptop for around $1200 or so. It won't be as efficient as the mac, but the power will be there.",0.0

Significant on paper not in real world scenario

Aside from that if you have $3000 or more to spend you wont be looking at macbook air.. this more for people who are only willing to spend $2000 for a notebook, its more a choice of getting a mac or a windows notebook.",0.0

If I was a hobbyist, semi or pro media editor I certainly would buy the MB Pr 14/16 as that is what they are designed for. The MB Air is for the consumer, casual user, office work, media streaming, etc. Even Apple said in an interview do not buy it for sustained workloads as it is not designed for that, which to a sensible person should be obvious (no fan).

"DCI-P3 70%... This machine useless, better get a PRO 14 (if you still want a MacBook). M2 is a hot processor, need in cooling system for it, for powerfull working. In default you will have a 35W charger, if you wanna 67W or higher - you should extra pay. You have no HDMI, card-reader, only 2 USB-C... MB Pro have all of it and 3 USB-C. Worst than MB Air M2 only MB PRO 13 M2. M2 have a little pros by M1, but not critical, also M1 Pro - faster than M2.

One more thing, SSD 256GB  have only half of speed 512 GB. System will be slower about 1.5 times.
If Apple got a possibility to using 24 GB on M1, then M2 have no chances in this battle, because 16GB - it's a minimal, 24GB - is optimal, 32GB - is the most powerfull. 64GB not need for MB.",0.0

- in gaming, the higher end specs actually present lower frame rates than the base model due to thermal throttling faster

- scratches are now an issue.  Stick to silver color
- midnight is a fingerprint magnet

"I absolutely loved that focus on the price as I too think Apple has been really manipulative with the price of this laptop. At first it sounds so great but if you look closer it really isn't. For me for expand l example if I Spec it out like I would get it, the MacBook Pro 14"" that is equivalent is just 200€ (yes, I am from Europe) more which is obviously with it just for the screen (together with the app that allows you to bump the brightness) alone. 
One of the reasons why that is, is because of Storage (as almost all the time when it comes to apples pricing) because the M2 Air starts with 256 (which is not enough for anyone in 2022) and the M1 Pro 14"" starts with 512 which means that you need to upgrade the Storage one time already to just be level with the 14""",0.0

I’ve watched countless reviews on this laptop and I have not come across a single one mentioning what you are doing in terms of an upgraded M2 air vs M1 14 Pro. I’m currently looking to get an M2 air with 16GB memory and 512GB storage for normal daily use, that’s $2499 AUD here in Australia. On the other hand, the base model M1 14 Pro is currently retailing at $2999 AUD with frequent discounts being as low as $2697 AUD on Amazon Australia (atm). That small little extra cost is not a whole lot compared to the huge increase in preference you get by choosing the M1 14 Prob in my case.

"I'm a Software and Data Engineer, and I use a lot of local and heavy-duty tools in my everyday. So last year I switched to an M1 MacBook Air M1. My main struggle at the beginning, was that since I never used a Mac before, and I needed to upgrade my laptop, was ""do I go for the 8GB or 16GB RAM model?"" so, for my current budget at that moment I decided to go for the 8GB Model with 256GB SSD, because I use another monitor so I needed the extra cash for an adapter. So, I've been working with that base M1 MacBook Air model for more than a year, and I can tell you, for the amount of work that I handle, I think is the best laptop I ever had, period, no questions asked. I typically use Parallels, and a lot of Python libraries, also lots of web pages, but the laptop rarely gets slow, and since is fanless it is quiet as hell. I use Clean My Mac very often, and typically I follow the best practices to have the battery life at its best, overall its been almost 18 months with that model and it is the best laptop experience I ever had. My only complain with that model would be that it is a bit small the screen, but that's not like a big deal.

I think buying this M2 model for someone who already owns an M1 MacBook Air, would be nonsense. I've seen the benchmarks and it is not a huge improvement, but it does cost 200 USD more.

Unless someone is upgrading from an older Intel laptop, or Intel Mac, this might be the one to go. 

I even compared my M1 Air, against a 4000 USD dollar Intel Mac, and it is almost the double faster.",0.0
"very weird that he didn't mention the real issue here, that 8gb ram. it simply isn't enough anymore and really the m2 macbook air/pro should ship with 16gb base while the m1 pro/max should be 32gb base. 

i needed a new macbook and i was 100% willing to get the m2 macbook pro but not at 8gb. going up to 16gb bumps the price up A LOT and at that point i just bought the 14'' m1 pro because i was spending a ton of money either way",0.0

"Apple wants people to buy the MacBook 14 M1 Max for 2000 USD.

"Okay, so… you are discussing American prices. And basically what you are saying is 1199 is too high, specially if you consider the fact that you can find an M1 for under 1k easily. Well, I’m Italian. The European price is an astonishing 1529€ for the 256 SSD. Even with the student discount, it still is 1414 while a brand new M1 starts at a more affordable and realistic 1114, with the student pricing. My question is, who is this Air for? Students don’t need a better chip and the M2 is barely better than the M1 in whatever a student or normal person would do. I mean, even for light content creating work the M1 is fine as ever. Is it for people who need to work with it? Doubt that. As everyone is saying, the SSD is so slow you have to upgrade, but upgrading means you are getting close to a price tag that screams “just buy a Pro”. Is the inflation and global crisis catching up to Apple too? I only see one reason for someone to buy this device: the brand new design. But hear me out: if you have never had a McBook, like me for example, you don’t need a new design. If you are upgrading from an older McBook, getting this M2 could seem like a deal, but it really isn’t unless you have the budget for it. If you need a laptop for work, you just get a Pro. In any case, this M2 will sell solely for the form factor and the new design. The chip is an upgrade that most common users won’t even notice and you can get a refurbished M1 McBookPro for the same price of this Air. I just don’t get it, but maybe it’s my fault.",0.0

"The M2 Macbook Air's single ssd of 256B in my opinion is not that big of a deal. Seems that no other people share the same mindset as me but I'll explain. So, you run your drive benchmarks and yes, the speed is halved, this I understand. But, swapping memory, moving files (not photos/videos), etc, the size of those files are insignificant. For example, if you move a software project folder, it has thousands of small files in it, then it won't matter if the ssd is capable of writing 3GB/s or 1.5GB/s, because the moving files are too small in size. Or when swapping memory, I do not think that flushing some pages from RAM will cause the ssd to take a substantial hit to notice the difference. Yes, when you try to copy that big video file from your external drive to your mac, you will get 2 minutes instead of 1 (almost double), but how much of a problem is that? Point is, 90% of drive operations the mac will be doing will be bunch of small-size files which will not impact the performance of a top of the line ssd.

"Absolutely preferred previous wedge shape. Held both machines in person. Air now feels it has lost its Air-ness. On paper, new Air at its thickest point is thinner, but overall despite what reviewers like Marquez convey the new squared shape feels thicker—my perception. New shape feels like a design regression. Not a compliment.

Good that they bought back MagSafe, bad they didn’t bring back SD Card—like 2017 MBA. Stop port-gimping the MBA. Teacher, conference speaker or amateur photographer who prefer thin and light should not need dongles to plug stuff in. MBP should have twice the USB4 count of the Air, but Air should not be missing basic ports. FACTS.",0.0

First ! Nice with the Casey neistat shirt!! Loved it ! 
Second, about MacBook … well, the problem is … the material, the MacBook, it’s still a battery to recharge,  a battery that will age through time, a battery to change within 2 or 3 years, 
It’s surely an amazing piece of work but now that I’ve ruined my first 2015 MacBook Pro, and that the main problem is the battery ..
I don’t know …

"What I liked is that this review didn't stick to the general benchmark trope and actually talked about when the performance hits would be observable. Secondly, goes without saying that it was very well presented. The quality just seems to be going up with every video. 

What I am surprised with, and it's something that's more of general trend with reviews of Apple products, is how easy reviewers go on Apple products. We're looking at a 1200$ laptop which downgrades the storage speed from its previous generation while upping the price and without declaring anything in fine print about this change to the users. So much so that most users are strongly recommended to upgrade to a 1500$ model by default. I don't see reviewers being as forgiving for a similar product by another manufacturer.",0.0

Please never buy 256Gb version of Air. I did such dumb decision in 2019. I get rid of it in a year and bought a 512 Gb version instead ... and it 100 times faster. I think previous models from 2019 had same issue with slow 256Gb SSD.,0.0

"£2k for the 1TB model is a joke for a laptop with a notch and less GPU power than a Pro or a good Windows gaming laptop. I saw an M2 Air in real life at an Apple Store Sunday and other than the notch, it does look nice but the M1 Air taper is ergonomically superior hence some ASUS laptops raise the rear of the keyboard when you open the display. 
And yes why are both USB-C ports on one side? This and the notch are lazy mechanical design. I wish Apple would follow ASUS and try some industrial design bravado as well as excellent fit and finish, their core competency.",0.0

"JUST SAVE UP $600 MORE AND GET THE BASE MODEL 14” MACBOOK PRO! 

Here’s 10 reasons why the base model MBP 14” is a way better value. 

1 - VALUE: on sale for $1800 at Best Buy / Amazon. That’s $200 off, which makes it just a $600 difference from base model MBA. 

2 - STOCK: readily available, whereas the Air is
brand new and can several weeks to ship depending on the model you choose. 

3 - DISPLAY: 1” bigger, even thinner bezels, higher resolution, 120hz Pro-motion, Mini-LED instead of cloudy/gray outdated LCD

4 - SOUND: Larger speakers for clearer/louder audio

5 - PERFORMANCE: Double overall performance, double the ram (16GB standard, compared to 8 on MBA)

6 - STORAGE: Double the storage (512GB standard, compared to 256GB on MBA)

7 - CHARGING: Faster charging out the box (MBA requires you to buy the upgraded charger to get faster charging)

8 - PORTS: Includes an SD Card reader, HDMI port, and 3 thunderbolt ports, and headphone jack (The only ports MBA has are 2 thunderbolts and a headphone jack)

9 - NO THERMAL THROTTLING: As a
result of the MacBook Air not having a built-in
cooling fan like the Pro does, the Air will drop
over 25% in performance after roughly 5 min of heavy workload, and it doesn’t take very long to throttle even under a moderate workload.

10. LONGEVITY: I’m no computer engineer, but I would expect the MBP to outlast the MBA, mainly because it has a built-in fan to help cool off the internals. And of course it’s more future proof, since it’s more powerful.",0.0

"I thought the prices at apple are expensive, because of development. But if we already, paid less for the m1 macbook air and they used the margin for the development of the m2 macbook pro, why are we still getting charged everytime apple is doing a refresh of a product.

Same with the iPhoneX. They showed us an outdated iPhone 8(7, 6s, 6) and then presented the iPhoneX with a notch, for what we paid more, but every manufacturer also published phone with a notch or a holepunch display. They sticked with the notch (x, 11, 12, 13) and now we are hearing that the iPhone14 is getting more expensive.. again because of redesign with a holepunch display that the samsung s10 already had in 2019. 
And after all of this boring years with a notch, they are putting it on the macbooks, with no reason. Becaue it would have fit on the macbook air.. because only „pro“ models deserve smaller bezels.. 
I am/was an Apple sheep since dhe iPhone3G, and switched to macbook sinc 2016. but its getting harder to still be happy with the brand, when they dont innovate and just care about charging more money for no reason.",0.0

"Unpopular perspective: They paid a reasonable price for ""transformative experience"" and believed fully unrealistic stories about how this transformation would happen as a high luxury festival so exclusive that in theory only the wealthiest (and strangely themselves starting at 1k) would be able to attend it and bathed in luxury. Then, they got none of the unrealistic things but only a highly transmutative experience worth around what they paid - but no hundred thousands worth of free extras just for having decided to be part of the elite now and separate from normal society.

So, is it really a scam if people got what they paid for? It may have been a few days of hell on earth but they also got back out again safely and their entire lives definitely changed through this experience.

I dunno, i feel like subconsciously people exactly knew what they wanted from the experience and what it was worth to them but in order to get around their egos, it had to me covered into so many shinies that ego was willing to overlook all signs of where this was really going.

I mean, this is not defending the people who set it up from greed either - i just feel like a mysterious hand was involved there to allow for a very select crowd to be able to safely experience what it feels like to be hit with a catastrophe - without actually facing the consequences of a catastrophe in their real lives.

I mean, it's non-standard but still, it's widely known that life-changing experiences usually feel like hell on earth. They may turn into something beautiful once you've fully processed what you experienced but the moment itself, it's just always painful af.",0.0

"Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country; for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness; and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. All this took about 450 years. “After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’ “From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’ “Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead, and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people. “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: “ ‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’ God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, “ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’ So it is also stated elsewhere: “ ‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’ “Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed. But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay. “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses. Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you: “ ‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.’”
Acts 13:16-41 NIV

"This is an example of why people need to learn to create and have someone in their life they can be fully honest with and receive criticism and get loud and maybe even throw a few punches sometimes and it is vital that the person is a balancing act in your life of either reason and logic or worry and fear, have the capacity for both. you will be able to give the necessary push back and voice of cold reason and negative reality or the positive reenforcement and open mindedness when needed. An example is my business partner and close close friend wants to build the biggest and most talked about and beloved music recording and events coordinator company in Utah it’s one of his life goals and dreams besides going to sushi school in Japan. He is so hungry for it that in four months we’ve gotten to where it takes most in the edm and rap/ hip hop industry in Utah he also will make fast decisions out of excitement even sometimes down right bad situations. Expensive ones. But not as many as could have been if it weren’t for being the voice of reason in his head. He almost walked us into a super bad festival that has only ever broke even twice and profited only 5k at most  other years. It is also offense to a lot of people cause it was a bunch of White House’s putting on a house edm show and calling it a pow wow.
If there was a business partner that cared this wouldnt have happened I think.
It’s hard to find and have friends that truly care for you when in business without money being the main motivator. We live in a culture where everyone wants to be the king, the mastermind, or even like a ring leader but no one wants to be ‘just’ the right hand man no one wants to be leader of the kings court if they can’t be the king. They don’t even think of the fact that they would be the first to whisper in the kings ear.So many people throw so many opportunities away simple out of a horrible pride because for whatever reason no one can accept a lot of seemingly basic and necessary social skills and work character integrity",0.0

George Harrison had something a lot different to say about Woodstock. From memory he saw it as not some concert of peace and love, but one of debauchery and looseness. He was disgusted by it. A Beatle was disgusted by a music festival, think about that. It's not like he hadn't taken his fair share of drugs and committed his share of sin. 

Kinda why the world is so fucked up. Irresponsible people thought the world was a game for a decade, so they could sit back, run their credit up, take mind altering drugs, teach children stupid lesson's and run some of the most important institutions when ""the game"" was over.

I wouldn't be surprised if Woodstock was a Government Operation. Mockingbird, Northwoods and Paperclip sound outlandish yet are completely true. Was this the start of the family breakdown? To get people to turn away from God? Partake in ""free love?"" Drugs? Because it seems that from then on America changed, for the worse.",0.0

These arent ""Premium documentaries"". This is just a random guy saying ""powerful group X is soooo evil"" for 20 to 30 minutes. For that I can just read a history book tbh.

so those artists are thieves?,0
He should have just cancelled the whole thing and cut his losses after the $20M investment failed to push through. That would have caused the least amount of inconvenience for everyone involved.,0
To be honest he was really almost close enough. The video puts it like the experience of the guests was supposed to be the priority but it never was. It was the content people can produce while being there having paid that much. Just had to make the food and the sleeping conditions look good on photos smh and it would work I'm convinced,0

"Jake, your sub count slowed down by 42.9% in last 30 days, and views came down by 30% in last 30 days.

I was wondering when you'd get around to this one,0
Jakes content has honestly taken a serious dive in quality. I’m sure he’s grown his audience and business but covering an old story that everyone already knows with a clickbait title? Cmon man. Quality over quantity. Most of these videos aren’t even Jake anymore,0

This narrator is way better than jakes annoying voice and lmaoo jakes apocalyptic tone of speech. Gosh was so annoying.,

Bring jakes voice back,
“Where is JA?” Pretty much sums up the fyre festival,
"If we want Jake to change, we shouldn't like, comment or watch these videos. I know I am doing 2 of those things right now, but I still have a little bit of hope left for Jake, but in my eyes he's just become a greedy capitalist. I'm definetly unsubbing. I will probably still watch the videos, but if nothing changes in a couple of months, I'll stop watching this fucker.",
"Ah fu** off, Jake Tran, you're the EA of Youtube",
I  want to know his side of the story. Like why I go that bad ? What really happened by his view.,
Ooh I knew this story from the tent picture alone!,
Listen pleighboi go back to narrating your own videos,
literally the Cayo Perico heist from GTA,

What is with all these YouTube's shilling for centralized exchanges when it comes to crypto currencies? You should be using Decentralised applications like Uniswap or DYDX to trade crypto not some exchange.  Centralization is antithetical to decentralized finance do decentralized finance which is what crypto currency is. Anybody arguing for centralized entities to come in to the decentralized space is a bad actor.,

It was cheese slices on wheat bread!! Get it right!! Lol,

I bet everything was going smooth until 50 cent felt like being petty and bought all the actual tents,
They felt like Mexicans crossing the border illegally,
Billy is exactly the kind of dude I hate.,
I thought it might have just been me being underwhelmed with the content as of late but the comments def confirm that this channel has peaked and whatever is left ain’t worth staying around for. Unsubscribe. Take care everyone!,

Someone need to make a Jake Tran style video about Jake Tran peddling all these investment apps,
"Jake, keep doing your thing bro! Content is top tier! It's a shame I can barely read through comments anymore because it's just people complaining about titles and sponsors........if you are a long time fan, why do you give af what the title is!? And he is not forcing you to do anything with the ads. As a matter of fact, he is doing you a favor by putting them in the video so you can skip instead of youtube ads that you can't skip. I wish these comments would fucking stop so we can see ACTUAL comments that have to do with the video. (I realize the irony as this comment has nothing to do with the video. I know people butt hurt by this will be rushing to point that out)",
"Jake, your videos are amazing but you have made changes (some quite recently) that are seriously affecting the quality of your content. 

- Your advertisements are predatory and not safe for people new to crypto. You gotta advertise, but please pick some better advertisers.
- Your titles and thumbnails give very little context to what the video is about. Personally this makes me want to see the video less. I've found myself skipping your videos recently cause I have no idea what it's about. 
- Why arnt you narrating your videos anymore? Your fans want to hear from you not a voice actor. 

I'm guessing you have recently outsourced alot of your content. It really shows",
Hey make sure i win before you stop the Instagram giveaway 😂😂🥸,
86th,
Give the locals they're props we put in elbow grease.it wasn't apparent it was a weird time in my life.,
Old news 🙄🤦‍♂️,
Just the fact that he spelled Fire Festival with a Y should have been a red flag,
That’s what you call dummy people 🤦‍♂️,
They can't catch everyone....let the buyers beware.      Ice holes...there's a axe for every seat.   FU46,
Nice to see the rich idiots struggle for a moment. Something most in the world experience all the time or at least 2x a month. I remember this.,
8000 Suckers lol,
Not financial advice,
Always shilling that resettable crypto Ponzi scheme aren’t ya.,
Love the content as always but you gotta get your intern a new mic... Please,
"Jake I love you channel but you gotta stop with the “most evil ……” Bc you’re literally turning into turn of the 21st century CNN. CNN lost its views and reliability by constantly saying “BREAKING NEWS” in the early 2000s and on. Your channel is gonna keep growing but you need to go back to your grass roots and give us less click baity titles and you need to stop decreasing you’re production quality. Something about you last 3 videos has me worried about your channel and where it’s going. Also is your audience we really only wanna
Hear your voice and no else that’s in your crew. We subscribed to Jake Tran not “Jake Tran and friends with clickbaity titles",
The one thing that you shouldn't care about being demonitised about is when it comes to JEPs list,
I never get tired of hearin about this scumbag and the disaster that was Fyre Festival,
wack,
Ahhh yes I’d like to see 7 BILLION people sign up to your shit and see the company pay out 700 Billion fuckin dollars.,
“Just 6 years” 6 years is actually a very long sentence for what he did. If you could make a lot of money scamming people why wouldn’t you.,
What a scam,
I woulda sued him and the celebrities that promoted it,
68k views and only 4k likes ;) speaks for itself,
Why the hell wasn't Ja Rule convicted?,
"Jajajajajajaja 

Jenner Bieber another's hunter hooker's Jutsu


Jajajjajajajajaj",
Recycling is good not with YouTube content,
I remember this. I watched a documentary last year. It was one of the biggest hoax and the the people that really suffered where the locals that were promised payment for all their labor and was paid nothing,
Everyone complaining about Jake selling out and advertising scam's need to understand that he needs to make money too and you're getting good free content so stop complaining.,
Bring back the old Jake Tran,
"I really, really am glad some spoilt rich brats and celebrities wasted so so so much money. Having to mill around like all the other plebs, sleeping in a tent, oh the travesty,  with no concierge oh boo hoo. I'm glad they got ripped off, that's how most of us feel I guess or probs just me lol. I don't care, can't tolerate minted people who haven't earned it themselves.",
I'm not mad this even happened,
Efery jeffistin 🤨 who is that 😂,
i. Trust capital seems fishy just like the fyre festival lol,
"“Jake I love your videos but, …” 

Ouch. It’s sad to see a creator lose grip on his audience.",
Clearly the money and fame got to Jake and he will end up just like the people he talked about in this video,
First,
"Total scam, that ""fyre""",
"I low key was laughing at all these pension kids ""suffering""",
"Effrey Jeppstein purchased a $250,000 VIP ticket for Fyre Festival",
"As an old subscriber, it’s sad to me to see how quickly the quality of this channel has dropped relative just to even a year ago! Jake, I really hope you try to look back into your past to see what your subscribers liked and enjoyed, to help you succeed in your future! We all want to see you do well man!",
"You and your team do great work.  I enjoy your straight to the point documentaries they are very not opinion based.  Just facts.  I have no clue why they even have ""The News"" anymore.  That isnt real journalism like the stuff you provide Jake.",
can you make a video about how the supreme court has sided with big business throughout history especially in the lochner era and recently in the citizen united case,
"ask those he scammed, he didnt get enough......from the investors to the people who got stranded
he also started a new grift while waiting for trial, selling tickets to thing he didnt have......",
the netflix documentary was so funny!!,
"Jake please try titles without the clickbait….. you don’t even need it…. I’ve personally recommended this channel to 3 people who subscribed and watch regularly now. That’s due to the quality of the Older content and less suspicious sponsor Ads. 

I’m hoping this channel doesn’t fall off. I don’t mind the outsourcing of VO personally, that’s the only way you would be able to push content out but please hear us out on the other issues",
I feel like if we knew the name of the team member talking it be better.,
Will jake Tran narrate his own video this time? Lets find out!,
Nice vid,
"the jake tran setup:
Man with red eyes in thumbnail
Some sort of “evil”, “I’m shocked” “cover up” “unknown” “Not gonna like this”",
Funny how everyone was praising your style of content when you were peaking… now it’s really gone downhill with you jus tryna cash out on scammy apps promoting to your fans. Who got you here. Even your titles lack any effort. Comfy now eh? 🤣,
"Exclusive for the masses hahahahah... oh people, never learn",
I love this. Just goes to show that most heavily marketed things are all hype. All the hype driven kids learned a lesson. You don’t need insane marketing if you have a good product.,
"I heard of this from ""Internet Historian"", and boy is he one of most underrated content creators of all time.",
"I love Jake Tran videos and all, but I can't help but find the fact that he says in the beginning of the video after the sponsorship segment where he is talking about some $1000 Instagram giveaway he mentions fake Instagram accounts and that he will never tell you to invest, right after telling you to invest in crypto through his sponsor. Kinda funny. This isn't the first time this happened, either. Also, people are clearly upset with his vague clickbait titles and thumbnails and him using other narrators. However, I don't blame him for using narrators as many other similarly sized YouTube channels have many employees in some capacity, often editing. Sadly, I don't think that Jake will have much more success if these things don't change as he's pissing off his old audience. I really do like Jake's content and style so it hurts to see this happen.",
¿Do we have to eliminate the Plutocratic terrorist and his microphone artist allies?,
first,
The Fyre Festival has been beaten to death already...,
Internet historian covered this so much better,
"Who else laughed their ass off when this shit broke? Seriously, I laughed so hard when i heard this. From the first commercial I thought it was a scam.",

effrey jepstein,
Love the irony of this sponsor. Also when people say “never a better time to invest in crypto” then “not financial advice” as you advise to invest in crypto with the sponsor. 🙄,
it feels like he uses his voice to make you think hes narrating the vid but only uses it to make you hear his sponsor its a kind of disingenuous.,
I like your videos but can you do more for titles and thumbnails related to main topic,
Another gem thanks jake,
This s old..... Netflix got this covered already....,
10:04 - 10:08: Did anyone else catch the vocal transition from typical Jake Tran into like some evening TV newscaster narrating true crime aftermaths :'P?,
"Yes he will pay everyone back using other peoples money, he just told everyone he starting a new ponzi scheme, to pay back million this one is going to be a very big ponzi scheme",
Wow I saw another documentary video like this about a month ago,
Follow the white rabbit 🐰🥕,

2. Shills for crypto
3. Profit",

Watch the Dokus  about him",
Lmao keeping my money! Can easily find out about anybody anywhere.,

ALSO MAKE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE TO HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL and MAKE SURE TO HIT THE LIKE BUTTON & ALSO TO SHARE ALL HIS VIDEO'S!!! 😅...  Please & Thank You Everyone!👻",
HSTLR did a video on this a couple weeks ago. This Fyre fraudster guy needs to be exposed.,
When TF did pleb status rate a few hundred dollars for a concert ticket.  GTFO.,

Then his dad made fun of it on Family Guy- so they did make money after all lmao,

Hmm,
The party was so unreal....really unreal.😏,
A fool and their money,
Dirty peasents deserve nothing but a pig's orgy in the dirt  I AM ON BILLY'S SIDE !!!! GO BILLY,

"you’re late, jake, people have been talking about fyre festival for years",
Internet historian covered this years ago,
"I rather have you put less videos out there than having someone else narrating them. Jake you are the identity of this channel it has (or it had?) your style, your voice and your name.
You can't just transfer it to someone else and expect it to work.
Plus, can we talk how cynical is it from you to constantly talks about scams and shady companies but still promoting businesses. How can we know they are different?
and today's title? you said nothing about Fyre just that a guy lied to people and oh that's sad
did he got to jail? or anyrthing? you switched to Jeffrey...",
Fire festival did blew up🔥,
#wewantthelist love your videos man thank you,
"Jake, love your videos and everything, but I'm tired of the click-baity titles and I'm also tired of hearing somebody else on your videos. I'll keep skipping until you're back or down voting, whichever I think about first. I'm sorry, but we've asked you for weeks to be the main voice of your videos.",
"I decided it, i have watched every video on this channel, but i'm not gonna watch another one with a clickbait title with no info for the video",
Did the narrator change after the Crypto Promo or is it just me? 😂,
"I love Jake and the documentaries he puts out but man these clickbait titles are wearing on me. Jake we get it, you can't believe that people are evil. Get some more informative (less clickbait) titles.",
"Lose the camera click sound effects, at best have it once or twice. Can't listen to this while going to sleep.",
I love it when Jake calls people variants of poors,
"For the sake of feedback, this topic has been done to death. Keep providing content on things that people don’t know much about.",
"He'll spend the rest of his life paying the people he scammed, because he is a ""man of his word"". Really...🙄",
"Meanwhile worlds greatest 
dance-festival is going strong next 2weekends aka Tomorrowland (Boom-Belgium) 🤙",
"Glowing red eyes have pretty much become a bullish on Bitcoin thing... and you promote iTrust Capital... so it seems weird you wouldn't know that, but it's on like all your thumbnails for villains instead. Lotta mixed signals. Not much context for your viewers on investing either (who might dive in over their heads), and it seems like a weird kind of ad for your channel.",
One of the biggest jebaits I’ve seen.,
What is operation chaos?,
Jake best journalist in the world!,
Just the sight of some entitled Little Rich girl sitting on that island crying because she didn't get flown out there in a private jet and the festival was a sham makes me happy and filled with warmth.... Lmao 😂😂😂 the tears of my adversaries sustain me....,
GREAT VIDEO JAKE,
Nice drop at the end,
"Investor: ""who's your branding guy?!""
Douche: ""ja rule...""
*Rejected*",
I appreciate the effort and quality that Jake puts into these but I am all too familiar with all these stories already. Literally every video you've put out recently is on an old topic that's been covered to death. I would love to see some deeper dives into topics that nobody else is paying attention to. There's tons of them out there.,
Unsubbed. His content has always been a little sketch with the shilling but plugging the crypto scam that steals your retirement fund is too much.,
So what did he get????,
"To do an event of the size Fyre festival, was supposed to be, you had to start planning a minimum of 12 months beforehand. They usually plan it several years before they plan on doing the event. They instead tried to do it in around 12 weeks, with a group of people who had no idea how to set up a festival. Most of them worked for the company making the star booking app Fyre festival was supposed to launch. It was always doomed to fail. 🤦‍♂️🤣",
Honestly don’t understand all of the Jake Tran hate. This dude is simply scaling up his business and producing a Netflix style documentary video EVERY 3 days. Stop complaining. It’s called businesses. He’s scaling…,
your choice in sponsors really calls your integrity into question my dude,
why do you shill crypto so much ?,
He did something you won't get away with. Scamming the rich. If he scam the poor he would be free,
"unfortunately jakes ""documentaries"" has fallen dramatically in quality, a cheap montage of other people videos, a lousy sponsorship deal, and a cheap voice actor... I miss the old videos where things were genuine...",

"GTA 5 Online player: Aha, Cayo Perico Heist 🌴",
Too many ads on your videos mate! They are interesting? Hell yeah but you are losing so many followers and viewers by this stupid idea of adding so much trash content ad!,
"Was he related with ""another"" McFarland from the Family Guy ?",
Jake making videos more than once a month is the worst thing to ever happen to his content.,
Jajajajajajaja,
"One name to keep me from paying the ""paltry"" $1000 for a peasant's ticket: Ja Rule.",
Jake Tran... my guy.  Your ad is exactly what you claim to hate so much.,
"I respect Jake for his content.

But him doing promotions for every possible crypto exchange app and stating it's claims to get himself paid over the videos regarding scams and scandals is a very clear example of how the content consumers need to be very aware of what these influencers are asking you to buy or opt in, doesn't matters what their content or their narratives have been on the social media, in the end they wanna get paid and they barely give a damn about millions of people watching them.",
Wtf man.. what happened to all the titles recently?,
Good content and informative,
"As always, nice video Jake; I would add a few details 'cuz I believe that McFarland's attempt to make a great festival was genuine, but he was a horrible planner who ""tried to bite more than he could chew"".

1 - The island he claimed be ""owned by Escobar"" actually belonged to the Medellin Cartel ex-associate Carlos Lehder, which he used to smuggle ""ice"" to the U.S in the 80s.
2 - By coincidence (at least it seems to be), the Exuma Regatta, a annual boat race, was happening in the island right at the same weekend of the Festival; all the hotels and resorts were booked with tourists who came to see the race, so the staff had to deal with desperate youngsters invading the property in the search for food and somewhere to sleep.
3 - An Israeli expert in big events was hired after many organizers dumped McFarland due to the conditions; he warned that such a festival would require a whole year to plan and build, so he asked McFarland to postpone the event in six months, but he refused. Four weeks before the date, he bailed out after realizing the dumpster fire he was getting into (good move); even after that, McFarland didn't gave up, just saying to his staff ""let's do like the legends!"".
4 - Ja Rule also bailed out right in the same day of the festival, he posted in his social media account that he had ""nothing to do with it""; perhaps he trusted McFarland so blindly, that he couldn't see he was a such bad manager.
5 - An interview made with a few buyers afterwards revealed that many of them would buy new tickets if there was a 2nd attempt to make the festival happen.",
There is a Netflix documentary about this scam,
"Jake you need to do your own videos bro, this robot sounding mf is getting annoying",
Hmmmm.... Making videos about scams and promoting crypto things same time? Feels fishy to me,
always brings a smile to my face to see the wealthy scammed like a common person,
The irony of doing a video on a fraudster while pushing an ad for crypto...,
Dumpster Fyre,
Man the start is reminding me of El Rubio and Cayo perico,
Jenner Bieber another's hunter hooker's Jutsu,
So ja rule was also a scammer.,
Could you do a document on the east Asian financial crisis of 1997,
The could've just rented a cruise ship for 2 weeks for 10 million dollar,
So I've been watching this video 45 minutes and you still yet to give me any information that I didn't already have on this topic your music in the videos is way too loud just talk tell us what you want to tell us and on to the next one you're pushing an ad you're just as fake as everyone else,
he wasn't that bad,
Netflix already covered this brah.,
"Jake, I love your videos, but the clickbaity titles are really annoying, and the fact that you accept literally any kind of sponsor doesn't help",
Festival people suck,
Guns out tounges out,
That shutter sound is too loud. Louder than narrarator ..the one we never got introduced to loo,
"Billy also learned that there is a sucka born every minute,",
I miss Jake voicing his own videos and not just the intro/ads.,
E,
Hilarious that rich people got hosed. Guess everyone is capable of being fooled,
Interesting channel but it feels like it’s one step from being super sold out and a money machine.. the slippery slope of YouTube gets all the humble ppl and turns them into greedy soldouts,
"Ha,ha! Rich people had to suffer for once",
"I dont get  how ghislaine gets 20 years, when they give people who have a lb of weed that/",
"Can't believe he steals over $26 million and gets only 6 years in prison, while all some people do is smoke marijuana and are put away for over a decade",
I watch Jake train not just for the content but for the narration.  If I watch one more video without an Asian man's accent I'm unsubscribing,
how much research do you do to ensure the legitimacy of sponsors?,
"You are making documentaries on scams but yet, you have no problem advertising and recommending a scam?",
"""In late 2016, something stranged happen""
00:01",
Such lovely and nice videos 🔥🔥🔥💯💯... Keep up the good work Jake,
A lot of these people got what they deserved for their unrelenting desire to chase clout and need to be “exclusive” with everything.,
The marketing was fyre tho.,
"before i watch this video, what's the name of the fraudster so i don't waste 20 minutes finding out his name from this title",
"So a guy was in their room, told them it's a free for all, and they just... accepted it?
I'd have thrown the guy out, stating that it was mine and I had the documentation to prove it.",
I was literally going to ask if you changed his name through demonetization then you said it.,
"Just disliked and unsubscribed, fuck your shitty titles",
Ja rule another thieve criminal,
How many more documentaries about the Fyre Festival do we need?,
Thank you for finally making a video about something I've actually heard of rather than banana republics,
Great prank!,
"My grandfather always says ""if it's bitter don't immediately spits it, if it's sweet don't immediately swallows it""
because something bitter just might be actually a medicine for your own good, and something sweet just might be bad for you

and Jake maybe (just maybe) you will make video about one of your sponsor in the future, i hope you'd be careful bro, your goodwill is being put on the line there",
Now Ja Rule shilling crypto and NFT scams,
Kindly use specific titles,
I think everyone involved got what they deserved honestly 🤷‍♂️,
I really wish that the channel playlists would be updated with videos that have been released within the last year…,
"These clickbaits and scummy sponsers aren't doing good for your channel, no one likes to watch rushed videos pumped out asap just because you want more sponsors",
"unsubbed, this channel is going down the drain with scam promotions and pawning off videos to other narrator",
17:33. Whoooo?,
It's actually a wonder that nobody died. lol,
Bro cant smile,
At least Jake still does the ads himself.,
the truth always been rewritten by $,

OH that's why you're mispronouncing his name ha,
I’m glad the audience has finally woken up to this channel. Jake… you switched up,
Any relation to Seth?,
Thanks for bringing the titles back,
I already know all these details because of Internet Historian but that doesn't stop me from watching this one.,
Make your titles less clickbaity and take better quality sponsors. That's all,
All I know is that Luxary can and is sold as a commodity that everyone wants. That’s the crazy part to me,
Dang.... You finally make Fyre Fest video. 📹,
Great documentary but I was expecting Ephrey Jepstein to be part of the story 😒,
Netflix already has a more in dept documentary on this. Was kind of hopping for additional commentary/footage not included in that one - disappointed.,
It was a true Fyre,
"Woah, early here.!",
"It's worth mentioning that they did actually rent out Norman's Cay, but the owners expressly forbid them from mentioning Pablo Escobar, which Billy started doing almost immediately, causing the contract to be cancelled.",
Fucking sell out,

I think this got referenced in Henry danger,
Dumpster fire festival more like,
"Meh, netflix covered It years ago",
"(The experience is beyond words)
One word: dissapointment",
Scuzzball middlemen. But also I don't feel sorry for any of these filks . All the partners are scammers all thw promotions teams scammers . Even the artists involved scammers . And as far as the people buy8ng tickets fir this . I remember th8nking how awful this sounded before it happened.  They got what they paid for,
"I think billy just underestimated the time it would actually take to build that kind of fest, and the costs too. Imo, it might not be a deliberate fraud, does billy have a history of conning? I mean maybe he just underestimated this project and made a big mistake that had a domino effect. 

What do you guys think?",

"I saw this channel's downfall coming a mile away. We all know Fyre Festival. There's a dozen videos about it. This guy is scraping the bottom of the barrel for conspiracies to prove, and is becoming one himself with the crypto-crap he's promoting. Congrats, Jake, you're a mediocre channel.",
Thieves,
1k for 2 weeks in the Bahamas is an amazing deal,
Jake is slowly but surely becoming the people he make documentaries about. rip it was good while it lasted,
I have no sympathy for any of the twads who brought tickets. Rich kids having a hard time is great needs to happen more often.,
"My guy said ""white bread"", you mean brown bread......",
Will you at least apologize to any viewers when they lose everything with your sponsor?,
You have. make a video on Pelosi's stock investment fortune.,
Billy has got the most punchable face ever.,
Fuck this clickbaity nonsense and your crypto scam,
"Just starting watching this. I really hope Jake mentions the real hero of Fyre - Andy King. What he was willing to do for water will be remembered for generations to come 😂😂😂😂

Just to add I love Jake but his sponsors are not someone I would ever invest with. Jake - Accepting sponsors blindly will impact your integrity. Your whole thing is the dark side of money and power. Yet you shill junk projects. Just keep what you doing and be more selective qith your sponsors. You will achieve natural growth and $$ will follow. However, keep going down this route  you will lose integrity and your channel will drop heavy. You have got something very few YouTube ppl have - the trust of your audience. Do not throw that away for a quick buck. Just my opinion but you do you bro",
"You know there are parties like that held already.
They are called cruises",
Awesome video! Please do one for the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia where they used Depleted Uranium to bomb civilians!,
This is a perfect allegory for the State.,
I remember seeing the ad- I thought there is no way this is going to go well because of the logistics issues- And then everything fell apart-,
We need different titles but still love the content and info.,
Effry jepstien,
*Jeffrey Epstein* WTF?,
I remember seeing ads for fyre fest and when I seen ja rule I instantly knew it was a scam,
Jake is not even narrating the whole video anymore...like wtf.,
Jake I ain’t gonna lie your content back in early 2021 or late 2020 whatever when I subbed to u was top tier quality content but your vids now all say “ThIs Is ThE mOsT eViL tHiNg” etc etc and idk man your vids just don’t feel the same,
so he will come up with a new scheme and take that money and arrange another ice festival,
your new vids suck,
Jake I love your content but this was not it comparing your older content. This was too much of a TLDR of what happened at fyre fest. Next and Hulu are much better quality. I recommend those docs over this executive summary.,
Funny. Oh they got they're inclusivity! Lol,
"Jake: I would never ask for money or invest

I don't know seems like you're scamming something if you want to see or hear about the bin Laden papers just type it in YouTube and it comes right up you don't have to pay for anything he doesn't have access to nothing that's not already pubic information already don't be fooled by the hype,
Why do you call him effry jeppstein? It’s that easy to get demonetized that you can’t even say his name?,

Ain't paying y'all ish 😂 but I do like some of the content you drop on YouTube sir 👍,
5:45 EW! Dude. You’ve narrated the first 5 minutes and 45 seconds. You can finish the remaining 10-15 minutes of narration. Your videos are excellent but the lack of narration replaced with some lame boring voice is absolutely disgusting. Your once excellent videos have plummeted in quality. This video would be 10x better if you would just spend 10-15 minutes finishing the narration yourself….,
"Ah, A fan of Internet historian i see",
Since when did jake tran start voicing only the first part of his videos? I dont like this decline in content :(,

The fact people have been getting top comments giving you suggestions and they’re just kind of ignored is kind of frustrating as a viewer. Just give your viewers some sort of answer whether you think they’ll like it or not. Like shit dude, even the $5 a month channel members don’t even get to hear you narrate a video.",

Almost six minutes into your video you actually got to the real video. Cut the ads dude. Or at least cut them back. If I wanted to sit through this much ads in a 20 minute video I would just watch tv...Fffffuck.,
All these sketchy ads in the latest videos removes all trust and integrity from the content itself IMO,

I don't believe for a second that he didn't use that leverage against them so they would help him faking his death. Case closed. No ones is ever going to look for him, because everyones thinking he was 'killed'.",
"Imagine if this Billy dude had actually taken time to execute on delivering what he said his company would. Obviously profit/loss is part of business but once you have a customer that loves your product/service they'd keep coming back, and once business starts growing you can raise more and more to expand it further.

And if he would've executed it good imagine the livelihood it would have provided the locals in Bahamas. 

Two things to learn is there's defiantly a big market for music/event festivals and not to underestimate the power of social media marketing.",
"I would have never clicked on this video if I knew it was about Fyre. There was literally zero new info here. ""Research"", like what? Wathcing the netfliz documentary, using it's footage and adding a narration?
And at the end we got a preview for another hot topic ""Jeffrey Epstein"". I can't wait to get private access to that research effort!
I am a recent subscriber,
I am an imediate unsubscriber.",
"You are paying off your old audience, Jake. Don't let the success get to your death",
loving the surplus of great content. idk how you do it,
Dislike this video we want Jake,
Take a deep dive on cold war and it's consequences on Africa,
nah for real where's Jake to narrate these videos,
"You could have made the title of this video in the into the title of the YouTube thumbnail because they are written well without even the word ""Evil"".",
This channel sucks now it’s bad generic content basically clickbait now I like liked it so much I paid but it’s my last month and I’m out for good,
"Please stop with the clickbait titles, we all love your content, not your clickbait",
I still don’t understand why it’s necessary to switch to a different narrator.,
"You hate to see it. Maybe Jake will turn the channel around soon, I’m not holding my breath though.",
What a brilliant scam...,
Honestly most things are to good to be true,
IH did it better,
"Start such a festival for real.
THEN NUKE THE ISLAND!",
I love how he calls them plebs - peasants lmao omg,
He didn't got what he deserved,
Rich kids get screwed over the end... nobody cares that your 5k festival was a scam lol,
"need more documentaries , more long and on mainstream topics like these. dope video as always!",
Stop the vague/click bait titles 🙏,
"This is what happens when you think that Woodstock was just another concert...
If you want luxury,you deserve exactly what you got. Exactly like the rot that gets together in Myconos,Greece or Mallorca to show off their undeserved wealth.",
In German it means Yes Rule.,
"So let me get this str8…. their plane ran out of ⛽️🤣. AND people would’ve known who Ja Rule was, the f*ckery lmao",
sounds like a scam. you can grow your crypto by 20% a year but when its loosing 50% value the growing part means nothing.,
I dont know Jake... With all these scams that you advertise you might have to make a video on yourself soon.,
make it cheaper then ill consider,
"Jake, yet again proving when you start to get viewers en mass your ethics regarding sponsors will go out the window. I can respect the fact he really doesn't give a fuck as long as we watch and the advertiser cheque clears.

While he has shady ads and shit titles I'm gonna watch but I'll dislike 100%",
"Finally you listened to the TOP COMMENT OF ACTUALLY MAKING YOUR OWN VIDEOS. jeeez

Edit; then I heard the other guy start talking not even halfway through,  officially UNSUBBED from your capitalized garbage 

I'll go to other people 😂😂😂🤣",
💀💀😭😭,
This sounds so good I am thinking of becoming El Rubio,
Second🔥,
"I miss the Old Jake. The Jake that didn't use clickbait thumbnails, wasn't a sellout, voiced his own videos. I subscribed because of Old Jake not New Jake.",
"This FUCK just said ""Invest in crypto"" Fuck you jake, you're a scammer, you just told people to buy the dip on the biggest ponzi scheme in the world. Report this fucking guy.",
Couldn't have happened to more deserving folks!,
"Fake it till you make it...
ITS THE AMERICAN WAY...!!!
THEY DESERVED IT...",
"Unsubscribed...
Reasons:
- Dubious advertisement
- different narrator in the videos(why make an appearance in the first minutes if we get stuck with someone else for the remaining 10 or 15 min? This ain't it😔)
- click-bait titles
- last but not least, all complains has been done before, but it seems to fall on deaf ears, nothing changes. 

I don't wish u bad things tho, the first videos were pretty good ,and thanks for that. Good luck and good bye👋",
The party was so unreal it never happened!,
Victimless crime bahahaha,
You’re not gaining nearly as many subs or likes because of these dick head titles,
"New viewer here but like, WOW. The video was well enough, if not on already tread ground. My concern are the MONEYGRABS. You make mention of 2 ways to directly give you funds and had 2 sponsors of frankly VARIANT quality, all for a 20 minute video!

Judging by your comments, that's not something you used to do. Willing to give another go but if they're all like this, I may just have to let this channel be. 😬",
"He charged far too little for what he was offering. 
Could’ve been an epic event.",
"It's been a great ride, but I'm leaving now. This channel has gone down the drain. Clickbait titles, lower quality content, even the new narrator that nobody likes. I miss the OG Jake, man. 
Peace, imma head out now. ✌🏾
EDIT:
From other comments I realise why this is probably happening. Jake knows we hate the changes, but he knows he can make more money by targeting a different audience from us, the ones he started with. Fair play to him.",
Never trust any muthafucka with a shit-eatin grin.,
effery jepstein? 17:33 😂,
"IDK why but I feel like his sponsor “i trust capital” is just another Ponzi scheme, i hope its not but for some reason I just caught that vibe",
"just make a video debunking that the supreme court is some kind of apolitcal branch of the government please , this needs more attention to be honest",
"With all those tents, mattresses, and styrofoam boxed sandwiches there sure is 1M worth of ""treasures"".",
"Jesus, no festival is worth $250,000",
At least he wasn't scamming poor people like our governing bodies. This guy is more noble than our government.,
That island is so dope why did they go a ruin it with a festival with a bunch of posers,
The sad thing are the garbage left behind and the local that not paid for their services,
You are moving too quick Jake. Too quick slow down.,
"""This is what youre actually supposed to be learning about in School and Uni"" LMAOO ur videos are interesting but don't get carried away Jake lmao",
I enjoy the content but i hate the shilling for sketchy companies,
"Guy: “Biggest scam in music industry!”
Also guy: “Buy the dip in crypto!”",
pieces of trash,
"I remember the Fyre Festival!! It was sad, but hilarious!",
Thank you for making this one I've always wanted to know what happened,
"I dont think investing in Crypto is great that the moment Jake, wasn't they a dive in stocks?",
Jake dgaf about his fans anymore and it’s kind of sad. He’s turning into the guys he makes videos about…,
Internet Historian already did that one,
2+2=5,
Effery Jepstein!! I almost died laughing!! 😭😂🤣😂,
kinda funny ngl,
Funny enough I was reading Paradise Lost before I was alerted about Jake's upload😜,
This narrarator aint as good as jake. Me no like,
Why is this guy and his monotone voice back,
Look up Andy King blowjob Netflix. Best story coming out of that dumpster fire.,
5 dollar a month? Lol,
I've watched this on Netflix multie times. Failure of the decade.,
"""Super Successful"" and Woodstock DO NOT go hand in hand. Financially it was as bad as Fyre if not worse. Bad comparison. Shows your lack of knowledge on the subject and dilutes your credibility.",
I remember this. Hilarious. Didn't feel bad for these people buying expensive tickets and coming to destroy the local environment. Only feel bad for the locals who had to deal with all the rich kids.,
"C'mon, it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't, ""...cheese slices on white bread."" That was wheat bread.",
"Your intro made me a lot less sympathetic to the people that got scammed. Was that intentional?
But the guy who did that is still a mayor a**hole. This isn't even his first scam and he screwed the workers, too. F*ck this guy.",
Effrey Jepstein 😂😂😂😂,
"Unsubbed. You have lost your way Jake Tran. All you do now is make shitty clickbait titles and let another narrator voice your vids. This is no longer “Jake Tran” youtube channel, just a random paid by Jake Tran to narrate his stuff.",
"we can barley say his name without getring demonetized

proceeds to say his name multiple times

lol",
Your voice is different hmmmmmmmm,
i love it when a man can duped and tricked so many rich snob and stole their money,
Jake stop shilling crypto‼️,
Sad to see your channel has started going down. You peaked too soon.,
I miss when Jake narrated his own videos,
Here to get one of the best documentaries.,
Engagement,
"Saying it's a good time to buy crypto because there's been a correction is naive at best, scam at worst.",
These crypto ads suck man. Your content is good but what the hell are these scammy ads.,
how much are these scams giving you that makes it worth it to scam your own audience,
"I went to a fyre fest themed bar and they had a tent, jail cell, the sad sandwiches, and the “ja rule” drink 🍹🤣",
Jake does an intro then one of his workers makes the rest of the video. This formula is getting old.,
Right bow is not a good time to invest lmao,
Are these videos no longer done by Jake? WTH?,
"saying ""Now is the best moment to invest into crypto"" and then "" i'm not an advisor"" ... yeah sure... then why say it's the best moment to invest if you're saying you're too stupid to say such stuff?",
"Trying to peddle every single questionable investment option on the market isn't doing much for your credibility. How about some RAID: Shadow Legends or BetterHelp ads while we're at it? What's that? You already did those? I'm baffled. I get that you have to finance this, but what you're doing is the definition of selling out.",
Glowing eyes channel,
the moment somone says not financial advisor i know he is full of bullshit,
"'Dystopian waste land', am 'rolling' hahahaha",
"A bunch of rich people got scammed, meh 😕 don't care and laughing deep down.",
"I just realized Jake tran is filling the void of internet historian. Very similar types of content, except internet historian is more funny memy.",
PLEASE MAKE A VIDEO ABOUT BIG COAL IN EASTERN KY AND WEST VIRGINIA….,
the suckers got what they deserved haha,
Crypto is on a freefall with some of the biggest Crypto platforms going down and Jake recommends another?Ok.,
Internet historian got a good video on this subject!,
Talk about late to the party all this has been covered 😅,
so these terrorists can steal with the show business?,
"Thankfully, my psychic phone friend told me not to go!",
why don't you narrate yourself bro im going to unsub,
epery jefstein,
Am I the only one who can tell that Jake doesn't even narrate his own videos,
"Not a single ads i haven’t skipped, so if people are worried his ads are an issue… their probably not worth their salt.. but is what he is saying a lie? If no, you have nothing but free knowledge and you are complaining… get it together summer!!",
Clever using Effery Jepstein to not get demometized,
"You are the fraudster here with your stupid 10 minutes ""ads"" faQing scumbag   fys dude.",
"All the money collected probably went to kendall,hadid and hailey for being in the promo 😂😂",
3:59 hmmmmmmmm,
So he didn't get what he deserved in the end.,
Why your most of the videos feel like its incomplete? 😂,
sussess,
"Ok, I'll do it. The way he pronounces ""successful"".",
Sounds like a cult..,
Who's Effrey Jepstein?,
I’m proud of that guy. He should keep all the money🤣,
MAFIA STATE = Jenner Bieber another's hunter hooker's Jutsu,
There's already a Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix. And it's incredibly in depth.,
"Sorry Jake, this vid was a fail. No, he didn't get what he deserved, he's already out of jail only 4 years after he was sentenced!! This story was already well covered & you barely added any new information. Done with the clickbait titles, done with your channel. ✌🏿",
50th,
Oh that's so amazing the thought of all those little rich kids just stuck on a desert island makes me smile from ear to ear🤣,
I truly feel bad for the workers who got put in a terrible situation and never got a dime.,
Jake check your dm's on ig !!!!,
Dude tried to become El Rubio,
I don't care about the party goers but the workers not getting paid is sad as heck,
Listen to your fans man…before you have none left,
"Narrate your own shit

The feedback is clear",
Clickbait,
Bending the truth Elon musk comes to mind.,
Cool,
This will forever be one of my favorite scams. Watching all these silver spoon kids get knocked down was hilarious,
I'm fine with these rich idiots getting ripped off... I'd like to see more of it.. Also is this the best time to be promoting crypto? It is scam as well.  I'm hoping more rich people get ripped off again.. I thought you had a conscience about these things..,
This documentary is shown first on Netflix,
"awsome just what these ""high end"" narcissists deserved, a fricking cheese sandwich! they should be scammed way more often!",
Baldur's Gate 2,
"My guy immediately talks shit about half-life 2 

Booooyyyyyyy",
My man forgot about Bioshock 2,
I absolutely love Hades. Never was a fan of those kind of games before but I love mythology so I tried it out and I’ve cleared it like 12 times. I agree 100% for 10/10,
"honestly i can't think of anything more fun than a thumbtack, so of course i gotta make that a perfect 10/10, nothing can really beat it in it's replay-ability and timelessness, honestly think it made my childhood.",
Minecraft and WoW are definitely a pair of 10/10 games,
1:00 Valorant's classic pistol sounds so much worst,
Great editing,
I've never heard of stay before wtf is that,
No playing half life today for the first time is amazing because you know how old it is and you can see how it’s the OG. Big A your just wrong about half life,
Atriold,
"I feel like giving a thumb tack a 10/10 is a very brandon ""no pain, no gain"" ewing thing to do. Just my personal opinion.",
Idk if he’s played them but I think both Undertale and Bloodborne belong on that list too. I would also replace Ocarina of time with BOTW.,
Breath of the Wild?,
"True. HL2 is a well polished tech demo with a great story. I wont go as far as you on the gun sounds. But yea. I died on shit that doesn't exist, got stuck reload, got lost for tooo long on that first play through. But still go back through for nostalgia and stumble on mods to this day. Crossbow bolts are still crisp btw. No 10/10 because we never even got a real finish to the Eps and no HL3. Mario 64. Yes - Still play a lot of N64 games and yall called a lot of the good 1s. (Snowboardkids/1080, Diddy Kong Racing, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Goldeneye/Perfect Dark. A few to add for contention) And apparently I have some others to look into.... Great vid and edit! =)
Edit: Forgot, RE4 is the shit, and your right KOTOR was held back by its time and excited to see you say you would be interested in a KOTOR remaster. =)",
Hitman is a 10/10 for sure,
Feel like God Of War needs to be up there,
I saw the thumbnail earlier and didn't watch it this time I saw it was an atrioc video and was sold.,
now this is a youtube video if i’ve ever seen one !!!,
"I haven't finished the Video yet but I strongly believe the original 2007 gears of war is a perfect 10.  Halo 2/3, Cod 4 & MW2 also have to be right up there as well but Gears was a masterpiece for it's time.",
I can guarantee you if you took the  entire population of the earth and showed them the first 10 minutes and 15 seconds i can personally guarantee you not a single person would say he stabs himself in the thumb with the thumbtack he was playing with,
Wow no rdr2,
"Perfect 10s for me are terraria, omori and celeste. Terraria because its 15 dollars on steam and you can play it for like 200 hours without much boredom with the 4 classes, difficulties, custom seeds, and like 5.5k items, not to mention the mods which can easily give you over 1k on their own. Omori because it has probably the best story to any game I have ever played, honestly go play it if you haven't. And celeste because it has a great story, great gameplay, and lots of content.",
Wow?,
csgo is a 10/10 game. in the realm of FPS it is the long standing king and it only keeps growing year after year,
You should give Hyper Light Drifter a shot,
"Saying HL2 is not a 10/10 and SM64 is kind of not fair for HL2. SM64 is based on some fantasy world where an Italian plumber battles a giant turtle, you can use whatever the fuck sounds you want for anything. You can start out with a good sound and then say yeah we'll add it here just cause, and it would still relatively make sense. HL2 us a Sci fi adventure based on human experiences and the guns probably sound the way they do because it's supposed to be in the future and they probably made a lot of progress to converting more of the energy of the projectiles into motion rather than noise. It would make sense future guns do not sound as loud since they should not blow out the user's ear drum with each shot they took. Also even if you didn't add HL2 to the 10/10 list, HL1 at least deserved to be there for leading the way what video games could be. I dont mind the HL series being tech demos since they have been pretty good so far and they should push us into the future.",
"Borderlands 2, Terraria, and Chrono Trigger are all easy 10/10s",
"Sadge, no witcher 3",
3:40 what is the soundtrack in the background??,
Good ones,
"Have to give Red Dead Redemption 2 a 10/10. It isn't perfect, in my opinion no game I have played so far is, and once you play the hell out of it like I have, you see the seam where it gets repetitive, but I think on all aspects, it's superlative. Best thing is, I think there's still a LOT more to improve upon in the next installment if I ever see it in my lifetime.",
"GTA SA, is 10/10 back when it still supported online and was active, the story is great, the huge map(even to todays standards is quite large imo), the soundtrack, the main characters, the gang turf feature (wish this comes back for a GTA 6 if it makes sense). Mafia 2 and Mafia 1 Definitive edition are 10/10s for me, mafia 2 i've replayed about 10 times, it also has DLC content worth playing. Mafia 1 Definitive edition was and probably still is the best DE title to every come out, amazing story line, if you play this after Mafia 2 for the first time you'll notice how the 2 titles are closely connected.",
The Bioshock series is the GOAT for me. Perfect blend of thriller and action. Keeps you on your toes and has a great storyline.,
Persona 5 is definitely a 10/10,
"Tetris is 10/10 too
Edit(as I think of more): All of the trackmania games
Edit 2: 5d chess with multiverse time travel",
"Did this man seriously say ""CS:GO 1.6""? lmao",
Crypt of the serpent King easy,
factorio,
Talking shit about half life 2 sound design! Have you heard the combine death sound!?,
"For me I'd say Nier: Automata, BioShock, Titanfall 2, and Bloodborne are perfect 10/10 games. The music in Nier and Bloodborne is absolutely god-tier, and all have incredibly fun gameplay, engaging world's and stories, and phenomenal soundtracks and music.

Edit: Also how do you talk about Half-Life 2 and not mention Ravenholm! Like say what you want about the other levels but Ravenholm is a masterpiece of a level",
"Before seeing this video, here are my 10/10s. 

Hotline Miami, GTA5, Oblivion, Portal, Fallout NV, Donkey Kong country, mario kart wii, and arguably wii sports.",
this whole video makes me so hyped for Atrioc to play the Ori games. recently completed the first one and it was an amazing experience every step of the journey. such a pretty game every frame could be hung up as a piece of art.,
"How is Mario 64 possibly a 10/10? No shot somebody plays through it for the first time today and thinks it's perfect. The reason it holds up is because it's fun to watch speedrunning, cannonless isn't the new player experience lol",
The Stanley parable. 10/10,
Donkey kong country 2 is a perfect game.,
I’m so happy I started this conversation with one message in chat,
"I think Hades is a 8/10. I think it is too short, I think 1 extra level would have made it a 9.

I found it too easy for a Roguelike with me beating Hades around attempt 10, after that I pretty much won almost every run. The only thing that kept me playing was getting all the artifacts to 3* and all the Chibi Stickers..

As for multiplayer games, I'd give Modern warfare 2 and Black ops a 10/10... maybe it's because of the zombies as that is pretty much all I played. However they were the 2 games I actually played multiplayer for thousands of hours... Also the main campaign in those were probably the best of them all. (and World at war)",
Atrio is near perfect imo. Probably a 5/6,
"honorable mentions:
Far cry 3 (2012)
Ghost of Tsushima (2020)
Call of Duty Black ops 2 (2012)
Titanfall 2 (2016)
Batman Arkham Knight (2015)
Grand Theft Auto V (2013)
Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
Final Fantasy 7 (1997)
Call of Duty modern warfare 2 (2009)

Maybe some of these arent for everyone a 10/10 (like gta nowadays but just remember Doing heists with ur friends after school. Also it was like the game with the best graphics for 2013 by far)",
"YEAH FUCK SKYRIM! Played 30 hours of that game and felt like shit the whole way through! I know why it's such a beloved game, I saw some Videos that were fascinating, but I'm sorry, it feels like ass to play, I hate it so much!",
"Big A is a dunkey fan, no doubt.",
"remember we are listening to the guy who stabbed himself with a thumbtack.

 which I think makes his opinions more valid, I've done that like 5 times now.",
"Blood borne for me is a 10/10. The enemies, the environments, the combat, the music, the bosses, everything about it is just perfect and their really isn’t anything you could change to make it better.",
"Halo 3 is a 10/10, dunno why youd pick 2",
"I grew up with Wii games, and I think that Wii sport or Mario kart Wii are bangers, by their simplicity and how good they aged",
"I think that rating games from the N64 era with the ""for their time"" mindset but also not giving HL2 a 10 is crazy. But also I think CS creating the 5v5 bomb defusal mode which valorant yoinked and made worse by making it a hero shooter has to make it a 10 because the format has without a doubt stood the test of time.",
super mario galaxy is a 10 for sure,
"Having over 3000 hours in Hades, I appreciate it making this list.",
"Hey quick heads up, you forgot to put the the best game ever made, enjoyed by many gamers and viewers including myself, ""Paper Mario"" up there",
"I think the problem with majora's mask is that the time loop gimmic works fantastic for 95% of the game, untill it becomes tedius right at the end. It and oot are both great games, but I think mm would have been even better with 1 or 2 less sidequests happening at the same time.",
You gotta make a tier list bro,
The Walking Dead Telltale game just for the story. Only game to get me to cry.,
I think Mario Kart could be listed as a 10/10 multiplayer game,
"Titanfall 2 and Risk of Rain 2 comes to mind when i think of perfect games. Also Talos Principle, but that game defiently isnt 10/10, but i just love the narrative so much",
"yo props to the editor, alot of the context and information given was seamless to the video, clean",
the thumbtack is a perfect allegory for league,
The only 10/10s I’ve ever played are Minecraft and Cuphead,
No Kirby or GTA?,
"Factorio is a 10/10 in my book. It's really designed for a specific type of person, but if you are, you WILL sing hundreds or even thousands of hours into it if you don't set an alarm.",
That bo1 pistol reload sound tho,
New Vegas is 12/10,
"Modern warfare 2 is easily a 10/10. Everything was op, which made everything balanced.",
"As a truly casual game dude, Mario 64, Silent Hill 2, Minecraft (post MS purchase), Far Cry 3, MGS3 and BOTW are my 10/10s.",
Zelda OOT and MM are 10 out of 10 and I won't hear anything else,
"I'll have to go with
Metro series (last light is so immersive)
Darksiders
Jak & Daxter
Tony hawks THUG1/2 or Pro Skater",
Day 1 of commentinf on every atrioc video just to boost it in the alg,
Borderlands 2 is easily a 10/10.,
Sekiro litterly takes every game he talked about here and poops on it,
Thps 3 10/10 100%,
"Breath of the wild has to be a 10/10, it would be a 8/10 if not for the glitches",
"If atrioc never had a roommate who consistently played persona 5, and he played it himself I'm sure he'd put it up there. If not a 10/10 maybe a 9",
"modern warfare 2 got to be at least in the convo for 10/10 game for the time. Intense campaign, memorable characters, and was one of the best multiplayers for the time.",
Im not a big jrpg fan but ffx and persona 5 should get a mention here,
Play Tunic,
"OMORI was easily a 10/10 for me. I loved every single thing about that game, from the soundtrack, the gameplay, the pacing, the art, not to mention the story. It nailed everything perfectly.",
For me subnautica is a 10. Your first play through competes everything the game sets out to do.,
"I think kotor for me is a perfect game, even with it’s clunky movement and weird textures. i’ve played through that thing at least 15 times and each time i was having so much fun",
great [vod link] in the description,
Would agree with a lot of these. Halo 2 absolutely a 10. Id say Pokemon Red & Blue also and... Definitely would add Starcraft Broodwar and sc2.,
Oot and majora Mask ❤️,
Slippity dippity,
Super mario gaxaly one and two are personal 10/10 games but i feel like they aren't 10/10 perfect games that everyone will love,
Shadow of the Colossus is an absolute 10. Ignoring the camera and controls everything is as near to perfect as a video game can get.,
"Hell i'll put my 2 cents in, 
Borderlands, it was groundbreaking for its time, stylized so it looks great to this day, and its re-playability is almost at roguelike status because of the randomized loot which on release was a new thing.",
conkers bad fur day and mass effect 2 are 10/10,
YOU CANT JUST TEASE ATRIOC RACING LIKE THAT AND THEN END THE VIDEO WITH NO OTHER CONTEXT,
Mario 64 is a 9.9 only reason I spite it so much to not give it a perfect 10 is because of the damn camera. And shifting sand land,
you havent played the Reach campaign??? the best one???,
Halo 2 to this day is the best halo by far. It's the melee of the series. So much skill expression,
Yeah but have you heard the sounds from Toejam & Earl?,
He's calling out hl2 for feeling like a tech demo while super mario 64 has actual 1990s tech demos as levels 😂,
Big A does it again 👏,
fitting that overwatch was blocked by the 10/10 in the thumbnail,
"Titanfall 2 is the greatest shooter ever released

The campaign is unmatched in the genre, even the greats like modern warfare and black ops don’t have anywhere near the emotional impact of Titanfall 2s ending

And the multiplayer is FANTASTIC with and insanely high skill curling due to the movement possibilities but the game still feels approachable thanks to intuitive controls/physics, as well as AI enemies to make little billy still feel like he’s contributing. Not to mention the feeling anytime you are in a Titan, it’s like you can’t be stopped.

I love that game man",
I think league has to be a 10,
I don't like Hollow Knight at all. So Sorry. Also don't like Skyrim. Sorry not sorry.,
Whats the vod for this?,
Hollowknight without Grey Prince Zote is a 10/10,
shoutout to jimmyjomby,
"Imagine leaving Atrio out of this list. Don't let us down next time, Brandon!",
atrioc is the type of guy to swallow a thumbtack because he likes the pretty color,
"FIFA 14, the true GOAT",
Return of the Obra dinn is a true 10/10,
"I cannot in good conscience give Subnautica a 10/10, it is way too flawed. But it is my favorite experience I've had playing a video game.",
"I know most Zelda heads will shout OOT for their 10/10. It is a GREAT game yes, but in my opinion ""A Link to the Past"" on snes was and still is the most perfect Zelda game there has ever been. Also as a side note, sound goes CRAZY in that game. Remember hearing the master sword shoot the magic rings when you have full health for the first time? IMMACULATE! :)",
"Sound... seriously... Maybe I'm crazy, but I could literally mute any game that isnt story driven, and would have just as much fun listening to a podcast while playing. Sound is not that big of a deal.

Also, these games people claim are 10s in the comment section, mostly all of you are insane. Naming niche games, games with literally no new gameplay designs, nothing revolutionary. Ya'll batshit.",
Inscryption would be 10/10 for me. The immersion it creates when the player sits accross Leshy is just amazing,
great editing! good job,
Witcher 3 wild hunt is a 10/10 game,
"Outer Wilds will guaranteed warrant youtube content when you inevitably want to shout from the rooftops that its the best game of all time, you have to play it offline though",
"My nominations are Breath of the Wild, Assassin's Creed IV, and Street Fighter 2.",
"I'm personally of the opinion that there is no game ever made that's a 10/10. 10/10 insinuates that the game is perfect and there is no such thing as a perfect game. If you have any gripe with it, it's not perfect, even if those gripes are excusable for whatever reason",
waiting for paper mario,
"“Shadow of the colossus” and “Doom” (2016)
Two beautiful games in my opinion.
Not to long and they achieve exactly what they set out to do.",
No bloodborne?!😨,
I believe that God of War 2018 is 10/10,
Crazy how atrioc describes his perfect game and how much he loves hollow knight to still not play ori.,
"Whoever said Ac black flag in chat, you valid for that",
"From the many games I’ve played over the years, the ones I would qualify as 10/10s are Dark Souls 3, Portal 2, and Omori. Maybe minecraft",
Botw in my opinion is really good,
8,
"Dude, gun was a perfect 10",
its ironic that i agree with the list and also think new vegas is a better game than most of those but i would never give new vegas a perfect rating,
"first game that came to mind was Super Mario Wii, great levels, great music, good run time, has. hidden star coins for try hards for world 9, introduced true multiplayer to Mario bros, best launch game of all time. Carried the Wii.",
Minecraft is for sure a 10/10. I just spent a night singing minecraft karaoke in minecraft on a large pumpkin tower. perfect game.,
Hollow knight loses at least a whole point for how much back forth u have to go to find where you are going. super tedious,
ALL that fuck shit u said about half life 2 sounds ..... i cannot believe u:(,
Compared to other fps campaigns titanfall 2 blows them out of the water. I'd say it's a 10/10,
God of War for me is a perfect 10/10 the story about everything up to the Norse pantheon is just a master class in story telling even tho there was some flaws with the original trilogy the nostalgia alone gives it a 10/10,
Half Life 2 has the worst gun suonds? Has he ever played GTA San Andreas???,
atrioc is right I also hate the pistol sound in skyrim,
"Celeste is a truly flawless game, I genuinely can not think of a single change I would make that would make it better",
"Borderlands 2 is one of my 10/10 games. It's not perfect, but for everything it doesn't do perfect, it overachieves in every other aspect. Hell, Handsome Jack alone almost makes it a 10/10",
I’m ironically I love talking about games in this way. Wish I could’ve been there at this stream,
Gran Turismo 4 was for sure,
"- Banjo Kazooie (and probably Tooie as well)
- Smash Ultimate without a question
- Secret of Mana on SNES
- Eternal Darkness",
"I gotta say, as someone who played portal 2 for the first time last year, absolutely holds up, it’s such an incredible game even by today’s standards",
"Bioshock
Hollow knight
Furi
'nuff said.",
"as someone who played oot pretty recently, i cant agree with giving it a 10/10. a lot of it does hold up, its really impressive and mostly still fun, but some stuff just sucks. tons of bosses are frustrating, and tons of little things with movement and quality of life are lacking, and worst i think is that lots of mechanics/puzzles just dont make sense. i was playing alongside a friend whod already beaten it and there were many times i had to ask him what to do, and when i asked him how i was supposed to know what to do who couldnt tell me cause the game doesnt actually tell you. i honestly enjoyed playing zelda 1 (with a map cause that games a disaster otherwise) more, tho ill admit thats probably just me",
"Uncharted 4, God of War",
I think a true 10/10 and a game that blew my mind was Outer Wilds. Genuinely think it's a revolutionary game and so fun.,
Never been this early,
Please tell me Nier Automata is on this list.... please. I haven't watched it yet. That is probably the best game ever made.,
"God of War has to be a 10/10, just a perfectly crafted game. Cant wait for Ragnarok!",
This is biased asf lmao,
Mass Effect 2 needed to be on this list mr streamer,
Though I love portal 2 and it’s my absolute #1 game he do be right about it getting a more boring every time you play it.,
Mafia 2 is 10/10,
Outer wilds,
"To the chatter name mark with a k at 4:23, you are the most correct person there has ever been. Titanfall 2 was likely the most perfected game I’ve ever played",
"I think comparing single and multiplayer games on this ""what is a 10/10"" scale isn't really a good way of thinking about it. I think the original Donkey Kong Country is a 10/10 but it's not a 10/10 in the same way I think Street Fighter 4 is",
"You cannot give a game like Minecraft 10/10 for what it spawned or how big it is, you give games that score when they are high quality in every single area and frankly Minecraft is not high quality in anything except concept.",
Rayman Origins is 11/10,
Terraria 100% deserves it,
The Life is Strange franchise will forever be unbeatable for me. Those games are simply unmatched. They tick all my boxes. Even LIS 2 which doesn't have the sapphic lesbian characters that make the other games for me is fucking fantastic. The immersion is simply unmatched. You will play those games and they won't leave you mind for a weeks after that. Truely once in a lifetime experience.,
Witcher 3? Hello?,
I think it’s mandatory to have a mgs game on a 10/10 list,
Bioshock?,
Runescape sound effects,
"CS:GO has to be 10/10, very few big gameplay changes in over 2 decades, because the formula just works. Also probably the best esports game to watch (league is up there too)",
How are you gonna show Chrono Trigger when you bring up bad PS1 RPG's. That's just blasphemy. It's not even on PS1...,
"Even though Half Life 2 has aged significantly in terms of audio and visual design, it is legitimately one of the only few games from the early 2000's that's still playable all the way through for a normal person - quite easily. 

It is hands down a classic that is a 10 out of 10 in all aspects when looking at contemporaries from 2004",
"I would put Skyrim and HL2 in the 10/10 category, but I can respect not doing so. It’s hard to argue with a straight face that they have no glaring flaws.",
"You could've at least included one large story game that actually deserves 10/10, like God of War or RDR2",
I'd argue every full 3d mario game (especially galaxy) and undertale excluding the fanbase,
"Mario 64 is definitely great and Portal 2 was fun too but I only have eyes for Celeste and only very few games are coming close to that. Doesn't matter if it's sound, graphics (especially love to detail), physics, level design or story. It's the best game I've ever gotten to experience and I doubt there will be a game that is able to convince me otherwise. Besides the mentioned ones I think HK, Ori, Hades and SMG were very great too. I didn't enjoy HK and Ori as much because I don't like Metroidvanias but putting that aside there's no way I don't admit that they're great games. The last one I'd like to mention is Noita because you rarely see games that allow the player to do almost everything they wish for but of course that is the main gimmick besides the random generated world and I have to say that the game is pretty bad for beginners but if you manage to keep playing there is a lot of fun stuff you can do",
"I can’t believe he didn’t even mention the only true 10/10, paper Mario",
"terraria was a 10/10 when 1.1 came out. now it’s probably a 21/10 with all those huge updates they kept making for free. it’s a metroidvania set in a sandbox, fucking amazing",
"I agree with SM64 being a 10, but I really disagree on the gameplay holding up today. I'm an ex-speedrunner, I have a huge respect for the game and its movement, but playing it casually was pretty rough, especially in terms of controls and camera. Even just looking at the level design - though it is iconic and has some good concepts, it's clear that it is a very early 3D platformer. I played it as part of 3D all stars, and playing Sunshine right after makes it clear just how much the genre had matured since 64.",
"just played STRAY last night and it was amazing, debating a 10/10 for the worldbuilding",
"Skate 3 is 100% a 10/10. It will forever and always be a game to fall back on and have a good time playing it. There will always be more trick lines to do and more special spots to perfect. The graphics are still decent even though it came out for the Xbox 360. The soundtrack is good, good enough to not mute it and turn on your own playlist instead. All in all, Skate 3 is one of the best games all time and def a 10/10. Anyone who’s played skate 3 knows how great it is",
Red dead redemption 2 is a 10,
wait where's dos version of Will Harvey's zany golf (dos version),
GTA 4 a solid 10 of a game,
"4:50 Zinjo giving the map size in square kilometers is what 96% of the world likes to see. Thank you king.

80 square kilometers = 31 square miles",
"What's with the HL2 slander?
Dissapointed.",
"Mario 64 doesnt hold up imo. As a Gen Zer, the controls feel jank as hell, especially after playing Odyssey. I think it was revolutioanry for the time, but its only really considered great by people who have been playing it since they were kids, or people who are willing to pour hrs into perfecting the tricks, which to me, means it cant be 10/10",
i originally played ocarina of time when i was 10 and i sorta forgot about it coz i preferred the other 3d zelda games with majoras mask being my favourite game of all time but then i replayed oot when i was 17 and i realised how well crafted the dungeons were compared to other zelda games and i find it to have the best pacing of all the zelda games,
left4dead had an psychiatrist and therapist on the the credits for making everything satisfying,
"One of my few 10/10 games has to be terraria. It has so much replayablility and the expeierence Is enjoyable all the way though. The soundtrack, the bosses, the weapons, and the environment all come together to make a perfect game in my opinion. Definitely would recommend giving it a try",
"Link to the Past definitely deserves a 10/10 too. It was way ahead of its time on the SNES with its dual worlds, and every dungeon felt perfect. You had a sense of open world but also had a clear objective at every stage of the game. Even now I believe it still holds up beautifully.",
You should play The Messenger,
Great list! Never played melee or beat sm64 but I know they are both great games. I still think a multiplayer game could've  been added tho. Like bo2 or halo 2.,
Commenting for the algorithm,
"I disagree on half life 2, yeah the pistol sound isnt the best but 99% of the sound design in that game is spot on, also out side of the game it was pretty revolutionary for its modding scene and things like garys mod and all the games that came from it, like prop hunt games, wouldnt exist without it",
"I feel like melee is socially a 10/10 but in gameplay it's definitely not
(Still high tho)",
10:30 wtf is that emote lmao,
"Minecraft is a 10/10 toy. As a game, it's a 7.",
Hear me out - wii sports resort,
So pog video,
GTA V,
"BotW, BO2, Skyrim, etc",
Like this vid but honestly its probably getting a 10/10,
boomer,
"I've played HL2 3-4 times, it's a masterpiece.",
[VOD LINK],
"if i had to choose a recent game, i'd say Red Dead Redemption 2, i really enjoyed that game and the story was great, the music OH MAH GAWD, and the side missions and encounters were done well",
"Even questioning Halo 2 is questionable, hahaha",
"Garden Warfare 2 is my 3rd favourite game but I think out of my top 3 it's the one I'd concider a 10/10. Maybe bowser's inside story but definitely not xenoblade 2 (which is my absolute unchallenged favourite but also very much flawed). Otherwise, I think I've played a couple games that near perfection. Undertale has to be a 10/10 for sure, so does mystery dungeon 2. I don't think it's perfect but I genuinely believe Astral chain is very close, that game is criminally underrated! And of course botw (and imo hw:aoc also comes very close but I'm propably the only one saying that, I absolutely fucking loved every second of 100%ing that game), and mario 64. Other games I've played that are very good are: Isaac, Dead Cells, Fighterz, Smash ultimate, pokemon Black/white, legends arceus, Hades, minecraft for suure, maybe Fortnite??",
Terraria is a 10/10,
half life sounds were iconic thats an L take big a,
Mass effect 2 ? Or whichever part you guys prefer but for me definitely 2.,
tf2 is a 10/10 ez,
"For me a 10/10 is probably Metal Gear Solid 3. The Gameplay is still one of the best Stealth Experiences ever made, the characters are amazing, it looks amazing for the time, its infinitely creative. Just absolutely amazing.",
I absolutely cannot excuse how someone in chat called Resident Evil 4 a 7/10. I need to meet this person I cannot understand what is going on in their head,
portal 2 is a masterpiece,
Phantom Dust,
bruh,
"Minecraft, Terraria, Earthbound, Stardew Valley, Yakuza 0, Portal 2, OMORI, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy are some of mine",
enjoyed the editing,
I hate ranking anything as a 10/10 because nothing is without a flaw even if it is a relatively small flaw.,
pokemon 10/10,
Ahaha give the thumbtack a 10 had me dying,
"Fallout: New Vegas is my GOAT, it was the first time playing a game that I felt like my decisions actually mattered. The STORY, setting, and even most of the dlc is impecable and holds up to this day.",
Pen Pen TriIcelon for Dreamcast was 10/10.  It's superior to Fall Guys in every way.  Truly flawless.,
Hear me out. Minesweeper,
Chrono Trigger / Final Fantasy VI hold up incredibly well imo.,
That thumbtack worked out exactly like League of Legends.,
"God of war 3 is so fucking good that it killed the genre no one makes games like that anymore, not even the new devil my cry is has cooler combat than gow3 that game just rocks, and it still rocks",
"Ill still play GGST just to hear that sweet ass ""COUNTER""",
"Reach is the best Halo campaign hands down. The change in pace of the story was unbelievable. It was emotional not because of the main character like other halo games, but because of the characters you grow to care for. A group of lesser known Spartans giving all they got to finish the mission. 10/10 hands down. And it’s new enough to hold up for a long long time.",
"I’m playing through Portal 2 for the first time right now, and I have to say I love it. The voice acting is amazing, the writing is great, the humor is genuinely hilarious, the immersion is crazy good, and the puzzles are genuinely challenging. Quickly becoming one of my favorite games tbh.",
I knew you were a fake gamer Big A....Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is clearly a 10/10,
10/10 game is for sure Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare.,
Unsighted and SSBU are my forever goats <3,
"Mario 64 is not a 10/10 game. The DS version is just a better version. Which makes the original, worse.",
"no call of duty?? the best selling game of all time ? lol. L list, we get you nerds are pc gamers and play cringe games, but show some respect on the biggest selling game of all time",
M&M Beach party is 999/10,
Deaf people,
"I really wanted to write how I don't agree with everything. But then I thought to myself: ""Why? You stinky ass?""
Of course people have different opinions on games and not everyone will agree that a game is a 10/10.
So now I respect your list and write hate comments on my alt accounts to make everyone angry and sad while I feel like a generous god on this account.

Edit:
Ghost Master is 10/10 and you guys don't even know what it is! Give that game a sequel you cowards!",
Does anyone know what stream this is from?,
"In terms of the RPG genre my go to is always Xenoblade Chronicles. It pushed that lil ol Wii to its limit for some of the most beautiful areas in gaming, a life changing story and characters that bring both heavy hitting moments and the funniest lines ever read.",
For me a 2014 roblox game called twisted murder is still to this day the only game I could genuinely play for years,
monster hunter 4 ultimate is a 10 out of 10. fight me,
any game that still recieves updates shouldnt be considered a 10/10 since they have the opportunity to fall off at any moment eg. roblox and minecraft,
I played Skyrim for the first time last year on my Xbox 360 so it wasn’t as polished as the newer versions at all and it’s still in my probably top 3 games all time,
shadow of the colossus...,
Bro tf you mean i played half life 2 for the first time in 2020 and i love it. Portal 2 is a better overall game though.,
Hollow knight <3,
"Skyrim is definitely not 10/10, but it stands in a league of its own when it comes to community content and mods. So much so that Enderal is my 10/10 game, even though it is technically a ""Skyrim mod."" It elevates everything from the story, to the progression, to even mechanics like stealth and magic. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who felt Skyrim was just lacking.",
None. I rest my case,
Chip's Challenge,
terraria ?????????????,
I don't think a game can get any more perfect than cuphead,
"For me darl souls 3 is a 10/10
Everything about it is perfect to me, it masters the linear souls like experience",
"""Halflife 2 is not a 10/10 game"" ffffffff uuuuuuuuuu - dislike and unsubscribe. For the record - ive replayed halflife 2 countless times and used to speed run it",
"Majora's mask is a kinda 11 or a 10 DLC for OOT, OOT is clearly a 10, and to appreciate the weirdness of Majora's you have to know OOT",
"Heard it here first, ""thumbtacks are fun!""",
"The swamp boat section in HL2 was so drawn out, I forgot there was *other gameplay*

Also, if there was a game that had Sunshine's movement with SM64's level design, it would easily be a perfect game",
"The problem with Sekiro is that it looks like the purpose of the game is to not play it.. and it ends as a boss rush
Like you come to a place, there's a whole bunch of ennemies, god forbid you dare to breath near of them and all of them start to chase you, you have a whole arsenal of fighting and escaping but to survive you can only escape, so you understand and you escape everytime until the boss.. great",
Atrioc saying hl2 isn’t a 10/10 because of the gun sounds being bad is so unfair,
"Bro, Fable 2???",
"I hardly ever hear about Enter the Gungeon out of roguelikes, but I trully feel like people sleep on it, I just can't realy think about any flaw that the game has, it is a beautfull, well balanced game, with great music, massive replayability, a verry nice lore and tons of references and inteligente humor. I understand that it is not a game for everyone, but for the it's genre I believe it to be one of the verry best.",
"biggest missed games:

terraria
red dead redemption 2 - need i say more
titanfall 2 - best movement shooter ever made, story was incredible
risk of rain 2 - probably most fun-oriented rogue-like
rocket league - besides its community being terrible it's probably the most polished multiplayer games ever made and the physics are very satisfying

anything i missed?",
Cuphead 10/10 for me.,
Team Fortress 2 would also be 10/10 if ValVe fixed game and bots didn't exist,
2:55 can confirm played it for the first time a few weeks ago 10/10 one complaint is that it would be better with giant red YouTube arrows,
"I'd say chess is a 10/10.
It was created in medieval times and engines now show how balanced it is.
You can play fast, slow, blindfold and online, which makes it a video game ;)",
"Katana Zero is absolutely a 10/10 for me. Sound, music, mechanics, animation, level design, characters, and not to mention the rich and beautifully crafted story makes this game one that should test the time and stand up there with the greats.",
I’d probably throw Diablo 2 into that. I spent countless hours in that game.,
"Tragedy to not have an OG Psychonauts mention, even though its a bit of a cult classic and has some flaws. The level design, art style, and the way they distill very adult issues regarding mental health into all aspects of the game absolutely blew me away when I played it last year.",
"Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, 3 are definitely all contenders for 10/10

I think MGS2 stands the test of time more than 1 and 3 because how relevant the messages it had are today",
Atrioc describing Celeste without realising it lol 0:01,
mirrors edge better be on here,
im convinced that atriocs hl2 opinion is for views,
dead space,
super mario odyssey has a special place in my heart… i’m someone who unfortunately finds it pretty tedious to play single player games but 100% it because of how much fun i had. the movement and level design is so clean and polished i couldn’t stop playing.,
Ghost of Tsushima,
"Personal 10/10 Games:
Papier Mario TTYD and Xenoblade Chronicles X.
Paper Mario TTYD: yea from an outside perspective it probably isn’t a 10/10 but for me it’s the perfect game, great music, amazing story, fun gameplay and very fun and well written characters.
And it’s the perfect sequel, it took a lot of systems from Papier Mario 1 and just improved them

Now for the more underrated Gem here: Xenoblade Chronicles X.
Admittedly it’s not a 10/10 game (for me it is) but again outside perspective it’s probably More an 8/10.
BUT the world is amazingly designed and vast, the combat is very fun with a lot of variety AND skill expression (if you choose to sink your time into it) it’s a great Hardcore player game, aka it’s very rewarding for people that sink a lot of time into it WHILE STILL being a great casual game too.
I could go on and on about This games world building etc. (HAVE YOU HEARD THE SOUNDTRACK? Uncontrollable is forever stuck in my head) and while yes it’s More a spiritual successor to the First it was still absolutely amazing. (Give it a try if you have a WiiU)",
I think ori and the will of the wisps is also a 10/10. One of the best I’ve ever played and a very emotional ending,
Superhot is easily 10/10,
"I'm a HL2 stan, but I'll agree that it's not a 10/10. There's a lot of unnecessary padding with the vehicle sections. But there's no doubt that HL2 was incredibly influential and innovative.
Hollow Knight is 10/10. And it was made by 3 people. Incredible.",
celeste is a 10/10 game 🙂,
"I agree, skyrims gun sounds are trash",
YOU FORGOT MORBIUS1!!!1!1,
Titanfall 2 is a 10/10,
if he says rdr2 is 10/10 im going to lose it,
NieR Automata still holds as a 10/10 for me with the way the story is told and the amazing soundtrack,
my only 10 out of 10 games are fruit box and jstris,
"Imo terraria is a 10/10. I think it achieves everything Minecraft sets out to do and more. I think the only thing Minecraft does better is the level of creativity you can have with building. But in terms of gameplay, atmosphere and replayabilty, I think terraria is exceptional.",
Dark souls 1 goated. That's all I have to say,
"Big A is spitting some truths on Half Life 2. Fantastic/revolutionary opening, but wtf is the rest of the game. It *really* falls off",
"minecraft is like not even 8/10 imo 
the coding is ass on java. the fact that you have to download a mod made by people to get consistent frames for a game made by one of the biggest companys in the world is insane 
also there is a big lack of content in the game comparing it to a game like terraria i dont think tis even close 
if you want a chill game id say something like stardew valley is miles better if you want something for exploration theres endless better choices including terraria which is more of a combat game bc the minecraft over world is all uninteresting and samey",
imagine talking about video game sounds and half life 2 and NOT SHOWCASING THE AR2,
i never comment but the editing was great. not sure if zinjo is new or not but great job. you turned atriocs rambling into a great video.,
atrioc we’re begging you just play celeste for a few hours please,
"for me, Stardew Valley",
Mother 3 without a doubt is a 10/10 it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played,
Dishonored 2 is a 10/10 in my book,
"I'd say Journey and Mario Galaxy are easy 10/10's. 
Deep Rock Galactic is debatable, but I'd say it comes very close to being 10/10
If Ultrakill keeps up the quality it currently has all the way to its full release it's also an easy 10/10 for me.",
titanfall 2 and the original sw battlefront gotta be added,
Outer Wilds is the only game i consider absolutely perfect.  no flaws at all.  you should REALLY play it but put chat emote only to really discover it,
"Disco Elysium and Outer Wilds are both easy 10/10 games in my opinion. They both take incredible advantage of the interactivity of video games to tell stories and deliver experiences that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. They're excellent games but also great works of art, and accomplishing both at the same time puts them each in contention for a top 5 spot in the list of all-time greats.",
Mario cart holds a special place in my heart,
"I actually think that either the new Spider-Man or Spider-Man: Miles Morales could be a 10. They're definitely 9s. The webswinging is as revolutionary today was it was in Spider-Man 2, so like Minecraft and Mario 64, I think it holds up",
He’s a 10 but he teaches economics on mondays. He’s an 11,
mount&blade warband is a 10/10 and i'm definitely not saying that to justify the fact that i have 8000 hours in the game,
"When the topic about multiplayer games came up, I instantly thought of Deep Rock Galactic. It's an amazing co-op game, I convinced my friends to play it saying it's like a mix between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead. Tons of replayability, customization gameplay and cosmetic wise. We bought it almost a month ago and we all already have over 100 hours

I would actually love to see Atrioc, Ludwig and Stanz play it ngl haha",
Breath of the wild?,
undertale is 10/10 even if the fandom is a little bit cringe,
"For me, the one game that hits 10/10 is Doom Eternal, Best singleplayer fps of all time",
Tf2,
"as someone who played every halo on release up to halo 4, i think Reach had one of the best campaigns. Maybe not the absolute best, but i really loved the things that made Reach different than the previous Halo games",
Resident evil 4. No doubt,
It’s funny you say this about the sounds of half life because I have like 1k hrs on rust and I solely stopped playing because they’re recently changed the gun audio and it’s just annoying and gross,
I didn't realize Big A hadn't beaten Elden Ring yet,
Oot is a 10,
"Sounds like nonsense to me. Minecraft was cool for a while,but after windows bought it... I can't even try to play it again. 

If I build my fishing house, then the fucking night bats come over and fuck my ass.
10/10 because it has modding?
It was so much nicer when there wasn't those super fancy gap closing monsters.

If you ask from me I'm not sure if I ever have seen 10/10 game.

I began with PS1 and started with Crash Bandicoot when I was 3 years old. My mom played it for me first,but I got the controller at some point,and I remember that I played the game for first in the level called ""Jaws Of Darkness"".
NaughtyDog delivered the games I had there were some games that weren't from them, but best times I had with games where I could share it with others. I have a little sister, and uncle, with one of them I played Crash Bash, and with the other I played the Sims 2 which was PS2 version. I think it's better than PC which doesn't let it play through as comfy settings as PS version does.

I think Portal 2 is 8/10. It has cool cuts, but as it lets the setting visually take a step out, I feel like you really are just taking a step into WIP game. I think that drops it a bit. It needs a beat there, but not like that.",
Where the hell is Fortnite,
"The editing on this video is so good. Not over the top, but enough added jokes to be hilarious.",
Uncharted? The Batman Arkham games?,
"For me there has been no game even remotely mechanically competitive while also maintaining the ability to utilize tactics and mind games like in Rocket League. Rocket League is a sport played on a screen, every single thing that happens is in your hands, you just have so much influence with everything you do.
Rocket League is the perfect esport game imo, that’s why it deserves a 10/10",
"'I'm not a big Minecrafter'

I'm guessing Big A is forgetting that absolutely fucking stellar house he built, Dream could never.",
"I love minecraft, but it's hilarious to me that you called it polished. As a speedrunner, you wouldn't believe the kind of bugs I've encountered in modern versions, let alone back when it released. Still gets an easy 10/10 for me though",
fortnite🗿.,
"shoutouts to the chat member who said outer wilds because i agree wholeheartedly, if you haven't played that game yet you absolutely should without looking up anything about it beyond the store page and trailers.",
The only reason he didn't list Outer Wilds is because it's an 11/10,
"If we're talking about perfect games, we need to speak about Stardew Valley. There's no one right way to play with the multitude of things you can do in it, and there's something for everyone to enjoy. The sound, music and gameplay are all so incredibly charming that you can't help but get pulled into it's relaxing and whimsical world. Even more impressive is the fact that the entire thing was made by a single dev who clearly loves his game and the community of players around it. 

Stardew Valley is an indisputable GOAT.",
celeste should 100% be on this list. legitimately the only game where I can't name a single actual flaw. Game is so god damn perfect.,
I think your avoiding the elephant in the room. The absolutely timeless classic of paper Mario. 10/10,
Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Perfect 10/10.,
"Can’t tell if the games showed compared to OOT is trolling or not. Chronotrigger came out on snes over three years before OOT, and FF7 was almost a year before OOT",
"Portal 2 transformed how I perceived games. I mean i was always a degenerate gamer, and i had games in my childhood that i definitely loved, but nothing captivated me like Portal 2 did. Perfect fucking game. You know how some people say they wish they could forget a game or show or movie so they could experience it for the first time again? I don't say that for much, because a lot of the time it's being able to connect with people over your shared experience that really creates good memories, but Portal 2 is the one exception. I would give anything to experience Portal 2 for the first time again.",
Breath of the wild 10/10,
"Any love for NieR Automata? Game genuinely made me cry, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the gameplay is amazing, the story beats are so well paced and put together. I really can't sing enough praise for this game.",
"I rented Super nintendo games from Blockbuster and one day my Mom and I walked in and the guy just about finished setting up Super Mario 64 and he plugged in a cord and turned the power on and he gave me the controller.

I'm surprised no one even mentioned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,
Elden ring is an awesome game but i can't play it cause ubisoft ruined open world games with the grind and exploring now just feels tedious and annoying. so i'd rather just play an on rails game than play an open world,

Stardew Valley? 🥲,
"Mario 64 cannot be 10/10 just because of the dog water controls. Even if everything else is absolutely perfect, if the game controls like a chicken with its head cut off, it can't be 10/10",
"The HL2 pistol sounds wimpy and weak because it is a wimpy and weak weapon. It communicates the weapon attributes through the audio design. It's also wierd how he ranked HL2 today's standards but M64 was ranked by its days standards.

I think Rocket League deserves mention when discussing 10/10 multiplayer games,
imagine thinking half-life 2 isn't timelss,
destiny 1 taken king is a 10/10,
without a doubt Minecraft is a 10/10,
Hot take: Skyrim wasnt even the best game of its kind when it came out.,
"For me. Again, me. I think half life 2 is a masterpiece but may not be a 10 out of 10 after what Atrioc said. However, it has been almost 20 years since half life 2 came out, and Ateioc is complaining about THE SOUND OF THE GUNS. If that is it, it is a masterpiece as people have completely different opinions on sound as moat people do not take notice of it.
Another thing to add is that the gun sounds of half life 2 vs 1, 2 is better because a lot of the game is shooting, so if you have an anoying pistol sound from half life 1 in your ears all of the time, you would get sick of it.
Also sice half life 2 got released 6 years after its original, the sound will have been improved and not downgraded. As there is no point of making a game which is worse than it's original, and all of the fans seemed to pick up on that after you see half life 2's popularity when it came out.",
"I always liken Mario 64 to a vintage gun, like a winchester model 70, for the time it was an amazing gun and even now it's serviceable since it's not rocket science on how to use it. But since then so many innovations have come about that if you've never used a model 70 it would feel very clunky. I was born past the time of the N64 and I don't understand why people still think Mario 64 is a timeless game. I know and appreciate what it did for gaming as a whole, but I think something like Banjoo & Kazooie is a much better game.",
God of War (2018) is the only 10/10 i have seen or played.,
I really hope that he decides to play ori with how much he loved hollow knight. Also Celeste is a 10/10 play it gh,

Half life 2 is a fucking masterpiece,
Metal gear rising is un ironically a 10 out of 10 no game has has a resurgence like it for a reason. It delivers fast pace action that no game has even come close to producing now. Nothing comes close.,
the editing in this video was a 10/10,
Halo reach campaign is so good,
"Terraria has ruined my view on Minecraft honestly. I love minecraft but it drops off so quickly. By the time you have all the good stuff there’s nothing to do with it, nothing to challenge you. I have yet to check out 1.9 so maybe the deep dark and warden have helped the issue but as it stands, terraria just does the crafting/building/fighting style game better imo!",
Fifa 13 is the most 10/10 game you will ever see,
The witcher 3 is still my favorite game,
"May not be a 10/10 but Titanfall 2 (and even Titanfall 1) should be in the conversation. Respawn really outdid themselves and went beyond everything they could’ve set out to do. It’s a real shame to see the state the servers are in now, and even sadder is the plan that EA had to try and murder the franchise before Apex legends was able to start printing money",
"Hollow knight, bloodborne and Terraria are 10/10s for me",
Where Deus Ex?,
"Mr glizzster, I would like a formal apology for your outrageous claims of Half-life 2, how can you propose Half-Life 2 as not a ""Masterpiece"" a ""10 out of 10"" and if Half-life 2 is not a ""10 out of 10"" what is your review on Half-life Alyx?",
Portal 2 is fun as fuck when you memorized all the puzzles because you feel so de-stressed,
kotor 2 10/10 best game with tslrcm,
I hope Atrioc plays both of the Ori games and updates this list.,
"For me, 10/10 doesn't necessarily have to mean ""Greatest game of all time"" material. Games, and how good they are, are ultimately subjective to the individual. No one game will please EVERYONE, but if a game is 10/10, then to me that means it achieves everything it set out to do for the audience it targets, and the genre it's in (either setting a new standard in quality or inventing mechanics that become a genre staple).

That being said, I agree with most of Atrioc's choices (not 100% sure I'd agree with Melee, but it's close). If you don't want to read a book, stop here lol. I would add a few more from my personal experience:

Terraria: I heard this quote somewhere that resonated with me ""The worst thing about Terraria is that it ends"". It has such a good hook with its progression system, and the amount of replayability and sheer polish it has, plus being a clear labor of love (pun intended) from it's developers makes it perhaps the easiest 10/10 I can think of.

Slay the Spire: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this game invented a new genre in the form of ""deckbuilding roguelike"" that games like Incryption, Dicey Dungeons, and Peglin have built from. It does everything it tries to do with flying colors, and anytime I play a round or two after a break, I find myself sucked in for the next few weeks.

Smash Ultimate: This might be obvious to some. It's a miracle this exists to the level of magnitude and polish it reached, and it will almost certainly never happen again. I know I said Melee might not be a 10, and my reason is that it is horribly (but understandably) unpolished, and that's part of the reason it holds up oddly enough. But Ultimate manages to triple the roster size, while still having decent balance between all characters, AND it remains very polished overall. Without a doubt this lives up to its subtitle of Ultimate, and join Melee as a game that will still be revisited even after 5 new entries have come out.

DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal: Yes, i'd consider BOTH of them 10/10. DOOM 2016 already set the bar for singleplayer shooters at the time of its release, and somehow DOOM Eternal makes it feel slow in comparison. Either way, both games are unrivaled by any other franchise to deliver a more adrenaline pumping FPS experience thanks to the hyper-fast paced gameplay and unrelentingly headbanging soundtrack. Also worth mentioning how detailed and unique the level designs are. Twin Masterclasses in the FPS genre.

Honorable mentions (9.5-9.9/10):

Kid Icarus: Uprising: Explained this in a reply to a different comment. Only flaw is the controls, port it to a new system with a more manageable control scheme in the ground segments and it's an easy 10.

Xenoblade Chronicles: Only the first game. Felt wrong to call it a 10 because I haven't played enough JRPG's to compare this to, but by itself it is immaculate in worldbuilding and storytelling. The fact this originally came out on the Wii astounds me. 2 had its issues, hope 3 doesn't dissapoint.

Basically every mainline Mario game not called Super Mario Brothers 2: The Lost Levels, or Mario Land 1.

There's more, I'm sure, but I gotta sleep at some point tonight lol. That's what came to mind off the top of my head, anything else I'm either forgetting right now or I haven't played. If you read all that, I'm flattered you cared that much about my opinions, and if you had any others I missed, let me know and why. It's interesting to hear what others think, and if you're reading this far, you probably agree XD.",
"I know it's a meme at this point, but my 10/10 is Witcher 3. It does everything I want in a game phenomenally: story, atmosphere, world, characters, soundtrack. I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting. I know that the gameplay is simple and boring for a lot of people, but that's part of the reason I like it. It's not an Elden Ring where I'm going to be bashing my head against the desk for an hour trying to get past a monster. Just enough difficulty to make it fun. Not the type of game for someone with a grinder mindset like Atrioc though.",
No goat simulator?,
Atrioc would probably fucking love Outer Wilds it's a crime he hasn't played it yet,
I know the video is about games that are 10/10s but you know what game doesn’t deserve the 10/10s that it always gets? Mario odyssey that game makes Kirby look like dark souls and any play through other than your first one makes me fall asleep,
What ever your a,
"I love melee, but sorry that's just objectively not a 10/10 competitive game. Only 1/3rd of the cast is playable on a remotely competitive level, and it also overcomplicates things beyond a point of reason and fun. Your judgement is just really jaded because of how many friends you created in the community. 

L canceling is a perfect example of what i'm talking about. If your moves just automatically L cancelled, the game would just be strictly better. It doesn't take any real skill, it's just muscle memory that gates bad players who don't know it's a thing. It's also essentially invisible, so it's just a massive advantage you're getting over someone new, and they'll never know it's a thing unless you tell them. There's also the coding issues, like Game and Watch aerials being counted as specials, making them unable to be L cancelled. Or even things like infinite stalls via Jigglypuff or infinite pummels via Ice Climbers. Not to mention chain grabs (like 10+ is a problem), invisible ceiling glitch, port priority existing, and like 90% of the stages being unusable. Also, bigger than all of those, the fact that every character has a different amount of lag after jumping before you can aerial. This is something that feels absolutely horrible to new players, but because you're not new you don't even remember that it exists because the timing is just ingrained in your head. Ultimate fixed that by letting you queue up attacks to automatically go off after the lag, which feels significantly better to someone new, and Project M fixed it by setting that lag amount to be the same for every character so learning someone new doesn't mean struggling to do even the most basic movements.

So yeah... sure maybe the melee you know with a ton of custom rules added on by players and the 7-ish playable characters is really fun and really good competition, but it's undeniably flawed in multiple aspects - which just literally can't be a 10/10. A 10/10 doesn't have to be LITERALLY perfect, because no game is literally perfect, but melee isn't even close to perfect. I'd still give it a 9/10, but yeah literally no reasoning in the entire world could get it up another point when you consider everything. Your experience playing vs other good players I don't doubt is a 10/10, but your experience isn't THE experience.",
"Through many years of experience, the game in my opinion that is a Perfect 10 is paper mario. Such thoughtful gameplay that is really is like no other. Big A you should play this masterpiece of a game.",
Play Outer Wilds Atrioc!!!,
Nobody saying Ori so I thought I'd at least put it up for consideration,
"Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, and Pokemon Emerald are my 10/10s.",
SKYRIM,
Arkham Asylum/city,
melee is not a 10/10 i get the comp scene is good but the game is so broken and buggy and VERY unbalanced,
What about Blooms?,
Mario Galaxy is the GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!,
Thumbtacks were ahead of its time 10/10,
"MGS3, MGS4, The Last of Us, RDR2, TLOU 2, God of War, Elden Ring, Uncharted 2, Assassin’s Creed 2 are the only games I’d give a guaranteed 10/10 to and will fight to defend that.",
"Pokemon red/blue, Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker, terrarria, castlevania symphony of the night and pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of sky are also 10s.",
"Deep rock galactic is up there, there’s nearly nothing to dislike in it",
Om pretty sure TLOU2 got near perfect 10s even tho Ghost of Tsushima was better,
Tetris 10/10,
"Kid icarus uprising was one of my favorite, but yeah the controls have'nt aged that well",
"Honestly 100% agree with all the ones he listed except maybe Hades but definitely Resident Evil 4. Hades is good, but it isn't a timeless masterpiece that we will remember 10 years from now. Resident Evil 4 is one of those flawed masterpieces. For the time it was absolutely groundbreaking and single handedly defined the genre of 3rd person action shooters that would follow in it's footsteps for over a decade to come, while putting a new action spin on survival horror, while also being visually stunning, all around incredibly fun to play, and the list goes on. 

However, having gone back and played Resident Evil 4 recently even with the PC re-master with a high fidelity graphics mod and an updated control scheme... The last half of the game becomes such a slog. You just start feeling like clearing room after room after room of the same generic bad guys like you've been doing for over 10 hours is getting to be a big chore, the witty one liners get weaker, and the whacky Scooby-Doo bullshit reaches extreme levels of campiness that shouldn't be possible. Enemies don't even become harder either, they just become bigger and bigger bullet sponges with new skins. That game could have heavily benefitted from more enemy variety and better weapon progression to make it feel less repetitive.

I feel like Resident Evil 5 really did what Resident Evil 4 did, but slightly better in every single way and I'd still give that a 9/10. RE4 is an 8/10 but still a genre-defining groundbreaking game for the time. I'm excited to see what they do with the remake and whether or not they will make it totally faithful to the original or iron out some of the kinks. Do you think we'll still be able to look up Ashley's skirt? These things are very important.",
PORTAL 2 IS FKING AMAZING YESS,
My gilzzzy Daddy,
"BL2 is a 10/10 for me. I've never played a game that is somehow more fun on each playthrough. The story is solid, but the gameplay is masterful and the weapons are also really fun to goof around with. It doesn't take itself too seriously with most of the jokes landing.",
not mentioning metal gear solid 1 or final fantasy 7 😐,
Terraria 10/10,
"Street Fighter 2, as someone who worked on the original Street Fighter back in the day, seeing what they did with the Street Fighter 2 blew my mind, seeing how that has led us to one of my favorite genres, I have to give it a 10/10.",
Just play kotor it will not disappoint,
"OoT biatch, sometimes the popular opinion is the correct one",
"Love me some Big A but including melee feels a bit weird to me (I've been in the scene since 2014, i love this game) because hes not talking about melee as a whole. He's talking about a very hyper specific subsection of the game designed for competitive play. He's not talking about single player campaign, break the targets, 100 man wire-frame survival as Donkey Kong. I think if Atrioc only played 2 minute coin battle as bowser dittos he wouldn't consider melee a 10/10. competitive melee is a timeless classic but melee as a whole game.... well it shows that it was rushed.",
"Resident Evil 4 truly is such a wild 10 out of 10. Solid gameplay. Great attention to detail. Fun. Challenging at times. But when you put time into it, it's so satisfying when you really understand its tricks and such. It's a game that keeps getting re-released and I don't mind replaying. RE4R has a serious beast to contend with.",
Banjo Kazooie?,
Ngl im sad you missed so many GOAT games,
"If you look at 2004 games (San Andreas, Far Cry, Battlefront 1, Doom 3, Red Dead Revolver to name a few action ones) you see why Half Life 2 is a 10/10. As you said it revolutionized gaming in general but no other game of that time was as immersive and it made everything Half Life 1 did better. Gunplay feels better, environmental storytelling is better, enemies are better, map design is better, not to mention that of course at the time Source looked insanely good.

Also nova prospekt is good whaddahell",
"imo Halo 3 is the peak of every FPS campaign ever + one of the best game soundtracks of all time, in a game that still looks beautiful to this day (other than the faces).",
"Outer Wilds is the closest game to a 10/10 for me, although hollow knight is a close second. The ambient sound, music, easter eggs, control mechanics, story and world, and the immersion i felt all added up to one of the best gaming experiences I've felt. I was so addicted to that game",
"Mario 64s movement feels weird, especially the camera",
Guitar hero 3,
"I think Metal Gear Rising is a timeless game. Overwhelmingly generic on the surface but has nuance when you really examine it, its nuanced. If not a 10/10 now, give it a few years i'd say",
I don’t think Atrioc has played Skyrim,
"atrioc if youre looking for a game that truly feels like a single player mmo you should play Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning 
its the most single player mmo feel i ever had and even if im wrong its just a fun action rpg",
Bioshock is a 10/10. The atmosphere and story telling is unmatched.,
1:20 all the gun sounds have been made iconic via gmod my man so literally no one cares,
"I think if we look at f2p structure, sound design, balance and game design, dota is closer to a 10/10 than league",
shit opinion lmao,
bloodborne and fallout: new vegas are perfect games.,
"I think one of the only fps multiplayer games that deserves a 10/10 is Titanfall 2. The campaign alone is incredible, and the multiplayer gameplay is some of the most fun ive ever had in a multiplayer game.",
"How you guys about fallout new vagas, it’s still one of the most iconic fallouts to this day in my opinion",
"I think 2 games i’d give a 10/10 are NieR: Automata and OMORI. Both have really beautiful stories and great music. The gameplay in NieR: Automata was phenomenal and although I think the gameplay in OMORI wasn’t as great, it still felt fun the whole way through.",
Love to see the hollow knight on the 10/10,
FF Tactics anyone?,
"I think Kid Icarus Uprising ... *miiiiight* be a 10/10. It's not perfect - the story is fun but a tough look from a serious perspective, and the sprint mechanic is the main thing that might stop it.

But the characters are so lively, the gameplay so fun and unique, the story so enjoyable yet compelling. I dunno, I just think it's neat.

Also shoutout to Neon White, which is a 10/10 to the right person but I've never played.",
I'm barely two minutes into this video and malding over this half life take. How dare you sir.,
"The HL2 pistol sound is goated, you're just deafened by the glizzies in your ears.",
Monster hunter generations ultimate and hollow knight are a 10/10 for me,
"Undertale imo is the best storybased rpg game, the story, the gameplay and the fucking soundtrack are all so sick",
Atrioc I hope to god you don’t read ur comments but on the off chance you read this you should play Rain World,
"Eh Minecraft has been so mismanaged and poorly supported I can't say it's a 10/10, sure I still think the game is great but it feels like there is a huge void between what the game is and what the game feasibly could have been with more comprehensive updates. I mean sometimes we as a community would go years waiting only to get an update that is exclusively different coloured blocks. Or they do that bullshit where they make us vote between two mobs, and I'm sitting there being like ""you're a billion dollar company, make both the glowing squid and the yellow cow"". It doesn't help that I look at games in the genres Minecraft helped inspire and they'll have single updates with more content than every Minecraft update combined, the likes of Terraria, stardew valley and factorio have shown up how comprehensively a game can be updated and improved and so seeing the route Minecraft took is disappointing",
the only perfect 10 in my mind is overwatch 2,
Any of the batman arkham series is a 10,
"Majora's Mask is the perfect game in my opinion, and is a lesson in how rich a game can feel when huge effort goes into developing the story through side characters",
trackmania ez 10/10. you dont even need explanation why,
"I can’t with Atriocs take on Skyrim, Skyrim was breath of the wild before breath of the wild",
"Rocket league is an easy 10/10. New competitively viable mechanics are still being discovered, it still has a massive and constant player base, and it offers a fun/unique experience to everybody no matter what level of skill you have.

P.S. game is unplayable between 1500 and 2000 mmr be aware",
"I think minecraft is great but it lacks polish. And with inventory being what it is minecraft is currently unplayable without mods. I think 10/10 is fair because of its legacy but minecraft is still an unfinished game.

People compare terraria to minecraft but in the level of polish terraria is lightyears ahead of minecraft. Terraria is an easy 10, minecraft only gets it because of its impact on gaming.",
Half Life Alyx. I have never had more fun in my life.,
"""If it came out today, it woudn't be considered a 10/10"" is a pretty weak argument. The context of when, how and why something was created is a huge part of why it's considered relevant. We could build hundreds of pyramids, stone henges and great walls if we really wanted to, but they wouldn't be worth anything now.",
Unreal Tournament,
Red Dead Redemption 2!,
"I'm going to leave this here. Dishonored 1&2, Metro Series, The Final Station, Far Cry 3&5, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Tomb Raider 2013",
garbage list. 1. Mass Effect 2. Fable 3. Halo 4. PUBG (when it had a playerbase) 5. Starcraft 6. Heroes of the storm,
Melee is not a perfect competitive game. If you need to mod your controller to play well how is that perfect. If it has 26 characters and can only play 8 how is that perfect. If you can fall through a stage and see that as normal how is that perfect.,
"wtf man now witcher 3
:(",
"It's hard to say it is slept on, but Disco Elysium is truly one of the greatest games ever made. No other game has gamified a narrative driven experience like it did. It is a once in a generation gaming experience.",

"Hot take…..
Geometry Dash is a 10/10 game",
Definitely very nostalgia biased but far cry 3 and ratchet and clank: “a crack in time” are two amazing solo player games and probably the best two games I’ve played.,
"It takes a lot for me to replay games but Terraria has always scratched that itch for me. Theres just so much content, satisfying gameplay, and amazing music. My personal favorite is all the sprite details which add so much to the already incredible atmosphere",
Halo Reach was my childhood,
All i'm saying is Card Shark is a pretty solid game if anyone wants to try a new game,
Monster Hunter World is by far one of the best experience's ive had in gaming.  I could play it a dozen times over with different weapons and still never  be bored.,
The edit with the dream stan removing atrioc from the dni list is fucking hilarious,

I would add Bloons td6,

"Dwarf Fortress, Mario 64, Hollow Knight

Edit: Hit them on the spot",
"Mario Kart 64 is the perfect game. The music, the gameplay, the tracks are all top tier. My brother and I have played it consistently for 15 years. I still believe it's the best Mario Kart. It's a game everyone can get into.",
I am very sad he didn't put terraria in the list,
sometimes when i watch chat i also think im in chat but its all just s simulation.,
Did he ever mention BoTW?,
Does he ever realize the hl2 pistol is suppressed?,
I know you probably don't have a lot of experience with it but as far as competitive multiplayer games go Rocket League is absolutely a 10/10,
I was getting kinda worried 6 or 7 minutes into this video without the ocarina of time mention. He solved it though. Undisputed GOAT.,
Gives melee a 10 but no mention of 3rd stike or any good fighting games,
"Not only did HL2 have bad gun sounds, it had a limited and basic selection of weapons.",
"DOOM 2016 and God of War 2018 are 10/10 or very close to it.

DOOM Eternal's game-play does make 2016's game-play feel worse, but there are just some aesthetic things that make 2016 the better game in my opinion. The difference between finding a weapon in the world and having a little cinematic as you pick it up, and finding a floating green hologram of a weapon to grab it is so massive. Eternal's weapon pick-ups just feel lazy in comparison. Dashes, swinging, and the meat-hook in Eternal make the game-play so much faster though. I think both are a 9 or 9.5/10, but if you could have Eternal's game-play with some aesthetic things from 2016, you would absolutely have a 10/10 game.

God of War's camera blew my mind and ruined a lot of similar RPG games for me. I played through God of War and then started to play Horizon Zero Dawn, but going from the seamless cut-scene to game-play cam of God of War to the comparatively jarring cuts as you start conversations or interact with anything in Zero Dawn felt so bad and I just couldn't finish it because of that. Action cut-scenes are phenomenal and look amazing, game-play is fun enough and challenging enough at higher difficulties to keep me engaged, and the game just overall looks, sounds, and feels amazing. Only thing I could complain about is the inventory and character upgrade system, but the camera alone added so much to the game, and I will always have very fond memories of playing the game for hours on end in my college dorm while slurping down root bear floats. Definitely 9.5/10 if not 10/10.",
"I'm willing to say that hl2 is overrated, but big A's gun sound take is abysmal",
woah,
"People being weirdly defensive for HL2 probably haven’t touched it in 20 years. Even as a kid I knew that shit wasn’t a 10, because everyone was playing Halo and having a 10/10 time.

The gravity gun was remarkably fun though.",
so only the games he likes?!,

Can't believe I don't see any mention of the masterpiece that is Chrono Trigger.,
Thumbtack definitely a 10/10 for even the glizzmaster to recognize playing with it,
paper mario 10/10,
I can't believe Atrioc almost died.,
honestly how could you forget about just dance and just dance 2. both masterpeices and beyond their time,
"10/10 games

I'd also put Tetris among the list of games that are legit perfect.,
Atrioc won't play Celeste because he fears the grind,
No silent hill 2?,
"I havent played a lot of games but Celeste and Hollow Knight are probably my favorite. The gameplay, music and difficulty is just perfect for me.",
Will there be a poppathon video?,
Hear me out…. Rocket league. Such a basic game but to master the mechanics can take hundreds to thousands of hours.,
"Half life 2 is a masterpiece, great sound design. IDK what you are talking about. The first two guns you get sound eh???? Yeah what about the crossbow? The THUNK? The guns you use most sound great.",
Broooo im missing Witcher 3,
"For me, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a 10/10 for me personally. Prolly my favorite game of all time",
"Everyone brings up Skyrim but to me Oblivion and Fallout: NV were both better imo and the longer I've played video games the more I wish I could play them for the first time again especially Fallout. 

There's never been a game that captivated me like those games did. I still have like 3 maxed out characters in Oblivion on a couple hard drives somewhere in my house. 

Thinking about playing Fallout again for the first time genuinely gives me an emotional response.",
"There's NO WAY Minecraft is not a 10/10. 
On a personal level, the sheer amount of time I have sunk into the game while still finding it fresh is unbelievable. 
The insane level of player-generated content makes it transcend the bounds of the base game imo, it takes to a level that no other game has achieved. 
And then of course you have to consider its unparalleled impact and influence it has as the best selling game of all time. Every open world, sandbox, rpg, or build-focused game will find itself drawing from and comparing itself to Minecraft in some way shape or form.

Easy 10/10 in my books",
ZINJO SWEEP,
"I don't think it's perfect but for me, Megaman Legends is a 10/10 game. The transition to 3D for Megaman had a lot of clever design decisions, graphically it looked great for its time, the amount of pseudo open world things and unique ways to play were so ahead of its time, the characters and story while nothing groundbreaking was all really charming and iconic, I can go on and on honestly.",
Imagine forgetting god of war,
"Bro, the gun sounds were coming in Half Life 3😩",
doom eternal is an easy 10/10 for me but maybe its just obsession speaking since i have 800 hours in the single player,
"The problem with kotor is you can’t play it on a modern pc without making file adjustments and modding, but 2 Star Wars games that are 10/10 in my mind are fallen order, and skywalker saga overtakes the complete saga just cause it’s basically Complete saga remaster.",
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance not even for the memes is for real probably the most pure fun game i've played,
"My guy forgot to mention some big games like subnautica, Jedi fallen order, terraria.",
:),
Witcher 3 and God of War 4,
"Tetris Effect is a 10 out of 10 game for me. They somehow made Tetris better, way more beautiful and accompanied by awesome soundtracks. Plus it had one of the best trailers of all time",
Chrono Trigger is for sure 10/10. One of the best games I've played.,
"MGS3, SM64 and Majoras Mask/Ocarina of Time and Fable 1/2",
"Outer wilds is my favorite game and is one of the most perfect games I’ve played. For someone who values sound in a game so much, I couldn’t Recommend a game enough",
"I played Mario 64 for the first time in my life 2 years ago on a mobile screen using touch controls , still loved it. No game (maybe other Marios do idk) handles as smoothly in 3d .

Same with ocarina of time. Haven't played majora's mask , probably a better game given it built upon ocarina of time but still ocarina of time is an easy 10/10 for me",
I think Old School Runescape is a 10/10 there has been no other game that had completely encapsulated an entire grade at my school and even to this day so many people play it.,
Outer Wilds along with its DLC has to be my definitive 10/10. No game I’ve played has managed to match the exploration and discovery of Outer Wilds. Just the concept of the game alone is so intriguing. And it’s all accompanied by a stellar soundtrack.,
"Portal 2 and Hollow Knight are truly the only 10/10 games I've ever played. I have other games that I've had as much fun in, like Minecraft, Cuphead, and Celeste, but man. Those games are just perfect back to front. Literally masterpieces.",
I swear to god if Hitman isn't in this list I am going to dislike this Video!,
Titanfall 2 ez,
Mario 64 is hot trash,
"csgo 10/10
some of the mid gen pokemon games 10/10
wildcard pick assassins creed 3 10/10",
All Metal Gear games aside from survive 10/10,
"It's tough to criticize the list cause it's clearly an opinion but all I'm gonna say is I think the criteria could be better standardized. Minecraft is a 10 because... I'm not sure? Melee is a 10 because it has a competitive scene and sounds good? I think I want a clearer distinction cause my list is so different though, so idk.",
"For me the metro series has some of the best environmental noises and music, all in all a great game series",
"God of War ps4 is an almost perfect game and I will die on that hill

Edit: Not sure if Atrioc ever played it",
You need to play Ori and the Blind Forest,
"Can’t believe my man is disrespecting Knack by not including him on this list, disgraceful",
"Halo 2 is not a 10/10 imo. I think Halo CE holds up more than Halo 2. There’s a lot that’s great with Halo 2, but i for me CE hooks me more and keeps me interested me with the gameplay.",
Pretty solid takes. I would think anyone who has put any substantial amount of times into league would also be pained to consider it a 10/10.,
How the fuck did nobody mention The Witcher 3. (Biased opinion tbh but still how?),
"you know what's an interesting game that most people probably won't think of that i would say is 10/10? chess, like if you really thinkabout what's the greatest game of all time, it's chess like's it's not even debateble it's chess",
Paunch????? 🙄🙄🙄 Omg CC fucked it again,
Falls guys fell so short in a time where they should have pushed a bunch of random ideas out. Make a create lobby option and or server list so ya can join lobbies in prep off peoples community stuff,

"big A starting off the vid slandering hl2 was a bad idea, i clicked off lol who knows what nonsense was in the rest of the vid",
outerwilds is the easiest 10/10 of my life dude. that game changed me as a person,
"I'm surprised you aren't a bigger fan of older RPG's with that singular focus mindset you have but, maybe you just need more stimulating or proactive gameplay like some of the games you had in your list. Or that you didn't have more platformers because of how pure gameplay and skill based they can be.

I haven't played them recently because of my job being all consuming but, Chrono Trigger and Paper Mario 2 have the most hours // playthroughs between anything else I have played.",
bro left guitar hero 3 off the list,
Windwaker,
"I’d say Mario Galaxy 1&2, Uncharted 4 and maybe spider-man 2018 are 10/10s",
but wut about fortnite guys,
Yoooo atrioc as a YouTube frog fairly new viewer I gotta say you gotta post more,
Did nobody mention BOTW???,
chess 10/10,
team fortress 2 is the goat game,
Big A went too far with that thumbtack jumpscare,
"Stardew Valley and Terraria are absolutely 10/10 games. I could replay both of them forever without ever modding them and still find enjoyment in them. I wasn't super receptive to Stardew Valley at first, but I've been playing it a ton on my Switch and I can easily lose track of time and just play it for like 10 hours straight.",
shoutout guy in chat who said littlebigplanet,
he really said mario 64 looks good but thinks ds3 looks bad wtf lmao,
Doom wasn't even mentioned :'),
I don't get why in this video they cut out the 10 minute rant on how atrioc racing was the perfect game and the only game ever to get 11/10,
"10 out of 10
Games for my opinion is Binding of Issac, Fallout New Vegas and Dark Souls 1",
"Atrioc shits on Half Life 2 just to give SM64 a 10/10. Man he really is going senile lol.

But no, it does NOT hold up well at all. That’s like saying Ocarina of Time holds up. Neither of them do, they are the Atari games of 3D platformers: primitive, inaccessible, and jank as hell. I can respect what they meant to people and what they did for gaming as a whole, but I can’t even play them because they have genuinely horrendous controls.",
No one mentioned New Vegas?,
if minecraft is not a 10/10 for you im sorry you either never had it or never had good friends to play with cause you literally make your own fun you make your own experience so if you didnt like it you didnt like your 1 playthrough or the people you played with and im sorry cause minecraft is great and im not even a zoomer,
Everyone forgets what year half life 2 came out in and it’s 2004 which is actually mind blowing to imagine how good the game looks and plays for its time,
Cuphead and hades are my only 10/10s this decade tbh. a handful of 9s that are close though,
"Personally, I’d also give Return of the Obra Dinn, Papers Please, The Stanley Parable, God Of War, Outer Wilds, Control, Disco Elysium, S.W.A.T 4, This is the Police & RDR2 a 10/10",
ace attorney ost = instant like + would subscribe again if i could,
bioshock?,
"I would put Halo 3 as a 10/10 that aged better than H2, just more polished. But that’s also just my childhood talking so",
"mw2 campaign, metal gear rising: revengance, Devil may cry 5, ikaruga, mgsv, ryse son of rome, titanfall 2 campaign and multiplayer, one finger death punch, subnautica, mad max (the game), battlefront 2 (2005), and satisfactory are my 10/10 games after the millenium changed",
"Two games i think deserve 10/10s are Psychonauts and Katamari Damacy Reroll.

Pyschonauts imo is the best 3d platformer i’ve ever played. The world it takes place in is unique and interesting: A summer camp for kids with psychic abilities. The characters are funny and likable, the art style is reminiscent of something from older cartoon network or nickelodeon, and the writing is great. Oh and the level design. The level design is the most interesting i’ve ever seen, with each level taking place in a different characters mind. There’s a level where you’re giant and go through a city, there’s one where your in a neon mexican culture inspired town, one where you’re in a mentally unstable person’s trippy brain. It’s great, you should play it atrioc i think you would like it.

Katamari Damacy is also great with its charm, level design, and music. The mechanic of rolling around a ball procedurally picking up larger and larger items is just fun. The controls are a little iffy and bizzare but i think that’s part of the charm.",
"Halo Reach should be considered an absolute masterpiece. The campaign is an absolute high point in the halo series, even when compared to Halos 2 and 3.",
"No undertale? Crazy. 

I guess it might not be his cup of tea tho",
"Team fortress 2 should definitely be a contender for the 10/10 list. If the bot problem we’re fixed (and valve fixed some of the tiny bugs), then you would be left with one of the highest skill, most fun, and unique games ever! I’ve sunk thousands of hours into it and haven’t even seen all there is to see! An amazing community workshop with limitless possibilities, a potential for a competitive scene, amazing gameplay for all types of players; it is truly a game to behold",
What about chess it should the test of time,
OW would have been a 10/10 if they gave it the support it needed to survive,
Outer wilds feels underrated,
The entire Donkey Kong Country series on SNES is a 10/10 for me. Perfect platformers with perfect music and Graphics that hold up to this day,
"I played RE4 for the first time a few weeks ago and I've got to say I don't really get it, the game just felt like a huge mess, some of the boss fights were ok but the game only really felt enjoyable when you're fighting off hordes of villagers, 

I feel like it was popular because nothing else played like it but it has not aged well.",
"I refuse to receive that portal 2 is so good. like imagine pitching that game prior to it's release - ok so you play as a plain as looking robot, tackling very simple puzzles in grey, unimaginative rooms - oh and there's little to no story and it ends rather quickly too.",
"this is gonna be corny but i think Undertale is a 10/10 for me. ignoring all the toby fox fuckery with gaster and the deltarune connections, on its own undertale is just so damn good. it changed what you could do with rpg mechanics, gave you an interesting story, a set goal, and then subverted that same goal all while keeping it interesting and fun. it has humor and style that legitimately anyone could enjoy whether you're a kid or an adult and (while i'm biased because of how nostalgic i am towards it) it jus tsticks to you how good it is. every character was done so damn well (even the little NPCs you only see once in an area) and feels really timeless. ive replayed it so much and ive managed to find new things every time",
Ocarina of Time is a masterpiece for sure.,
"I'm so glad he said that about HL2, been saying this for years. 6 or 7/10 game at most. HL1 is probably a 9 though",
both ori games are ten out of ten,
"I really wish Megaman Legends got more love during the ps1/n64 era. Is it a 10/10, no probably not. But it had a great mixture of charm, story, and rpg elements.",
didnt mention undertale,
Literally consistently played minecraft for 9 years and watched content for 11 years. I’m 20 years old now and still the game holds up,
"If a perfect game is a game that does everything it set out to do, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is that. Perfect linear fps campaign with the best missions in the series. Every single FPS game that has come out since has replicated the standard that Cod 4 set for multiplayer games.",
"My list of 10/10s (off the top of my head) are
Minecraft
Celeste
Hollow Knight
Super Mario World
Mario 64
Mario Galaxy 2
Mario Odyssey
Smash Melee
Smash Ultimate
Portal 2
TLOZ: ALTTP
TLOZ: Ocarina of Time
TLOZ: Majora's Mask
TLOZ: Windwaker
TLOZ: BOTW
Outer Wilds
Journey
the original Plants vs Zombies
Mario Kart 7

Never played FromSoft games, Halo, Resident Evil, TLOS, 2D Sonic, or DK Country before,  but I probably will play all of these eventually, except maybe RE and TLOS.
I played Undertale but couldn't get into it as I was playing Hollow Knight at the time. I might return and give it another shot because the music is great.
I am a bit biased on Mario Kart 7 because I played soooo much of it. I have played a ton of all of these but the rest were actually masterpieces.
My most played game by far is minecraft but I have also put significant time into Celeste, Hollow Knight, all of the TLOZ games, Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 7, and a bunch of others that did not quite make the list
Hades was great but I got bored after a while so it didn't make the list. Same for doom",
10 !,
Any Witcher 3 enjoyers?,
I will fight for Titanfall 2 and both KOTORs to be on this list. Mainly Titanfall 2 though because the KOTOR remake will hopefully be a 10/10.,
"Prey (2017) is a perfect 10, I feel it got critically overlooked.",
His Half Life 2 takes are cringe ngl. Combat is not the focus of HL2.,
Atrioc has a point with majoras mask but I could of never been the same without Oot,
"Final Fantasy has some minor gameplay flaws considering its age, but their storytelling is great making FF7 and FF9 both perfect for me. Persona 5 Royal is also flawless with the best sound design and character writing of any game. (Also the Zelda Series has so many classics.) Aside from JRPGs, God of War 2018 is amazing and worthy of a 10/10.",
imagine considering 10/10 for league when dota is around for like twice as long,
"dead space 2, bioshock infinite, and all metro games ez 10's tbh",
i would give undertale a 10/10 for how brilliant it is plus i still feel like it holds up today,
"Honestly it makes me sad not to see terraria mentioned in this video, It’s such a phenomenal game beloved by nearly everyone and has a massive fan base yet for some reason it always seems to be absent from discourse regarding the greatest games.",
My real 10/10 is pocket mirror and I will forever recommend it to anyone I meet,
"Celeste to me is a 10/10.  It has an amazing story and the way that each stage introduces really cool unique mechanics while remaining beatable is insane.  Then it offers plenty of hardcore content for players who love incredibly hard platformers, but even if you skip that because the game is to hard it is still amazing.",
"I have more hours in hades than I do any other game, so I smiled very big when he said it’s 10/10. Witcher 3 wild hunt (especially the 2 dlc) is also a 10/10",
But what about Roblox?,
I think the problem is a lot of people seem to confuse their favorite games with those that are truly 10/10,
can't believe he forgot bloons,
"Super Metroid for me is a 10/10. I struggle to play some older 2d platformers, but NO game has made me just want to pour thousands of hours into a speedrun like Super Metroid. The movement is probably the cleanest and most satisfying in a speedgame once mastered (in my opinion). The mechanics, ost, sound design, animations, and bosses are so ahead of their time. It’s also one of the games that is credited for speedrunning in general. Amazing amazing casual game, and speedgame. 

Super Mario Galaxy is probably a 10/10. That game looks phenomenal, has some of the most iconic music in any game, has super satisfying and easy to grasp movement, and has some of the greatest level design (imo). The only kinda meh thing is the bosses are kind mid. Even with that, I still believe it’s a 10/10. 

Terraria is a 10/10 too imo. So much replayability. The music, sprites, bosses, classes, biomes, devs, and creativity is insane. The modding scene makes the game 100x more expansive. It’s also one of the games that I think is even more fun when you play with a friend. Phenomenal game.",
Terraria ez,
how tf is this guy saying the hl2 ending is a let down? shit was dope af,
I’ve just started playing portal 2 for the first time and it is so good fr,
Hades is not a 10/10 because progression is gated behind random dialogue popping up. It's fucking infuriating making no progress in the story or unlocking the legendary aspects purely because the wrong speech bubble shows up.,
"I feel like calling Melee a 10/10 is crazy considering it’s obvious flaws. The community is very strong, but that’s not the same as the game being perfect or near it. I would struggle to even call the game a perfect competitive game considering the very clear lack of balance…

It’s good, but 10/10 is really biased. I would think 8 is more accurate.",
"HL2 had shitty but iconic gun sounds.  
Like i can still hear the muddy thumpin of the pulse rifle and i didn't even get much into half life",
Definitely go play outer wilds,
"All 10/10’s are valid, but my #1 above every single game ever made and ever will be made is Final Fantasy Tactics",
Outer Wilds is definitely the best game I’ve ever played and the DLC is close to if not just as good as the base game. Truly an amazing gaming experience that is unmatched by anything else I’ve played.,
"I think a lot of people dont get why minecraft is so great because they don't look at it through the lens of what it actually is, a SANDBOX game. And it's easily one of, if not the best sandbox games ever made. Seems like a simple game on the surface but really it's depth is endless if you keep digging in to it.",
Cod 4,
I agree completely with what you have in the 10/10 group but Imo I would add fallout: new Vegas,
"I think that the argument of HL2 not being a 10/10 due to its lackluster pistol and smg sounds is wild. Most of the sounds are phenomenal, baring those two (even though I do love the smg), the physics engine changed gaming forever. Without Half Life 2 showcasing the Source Engine, and what physics could be in a game, we would be in a different place now.  Not only that, but the NPCs interact amazingly, the story is great, and it just feels good to play still. I think you were way off base on this one",
"The take that Half life 2 isn't legendary but Mario 64 is, is completely jaded by being a streamer and knowing speedrunners. Mario 64 has not aged well and if you went back and played that remake that came out you know. Half-Life 2 is completely replayable, Ravenholm is probably one of the best FPS levels of all time",
To me Ori and the Blind Forest is an absolute 10/10,
"Persona 5, celeste, littlebigplanet, BOTW are 10s for me",
Celeste 10/10,
AoE2,
"I think the best way to do it is to go by genre because obviously someone who doesn’t like platformers still isn’t going to enjoy a “10/10” platformer and it’s hard to compare a turn based RPG with a 3D action game for example. From the games I’ve played I’d say Persona 5 Royal is a 10/10 for RPG’s, it might not be everyone’s cup of tea with the setting but in terms of game mechanics, music, characters/world building it’s the most polished RPG I’ve played (even though Xenoblade Chronicles is my favourite the sidequests are kinda ass so idk if I can give it an “objective” 10/10)
Also Smash Ultimate as a party fighter with the option of being competitive couldn’t be more perfect with its roster and stage selection, I guess the only thing that could be better is the singleplayer but I still think it’s a 10/10
Finally maybe Breath of the Wild as an open world game but that might be more of a 9/10 than a 10",
"Half life 2 was good but half life 1 is undeniably better, so half life 2 is definitely not a master piece. Half life 2 was a tech demo for the engine, which is a master piece.",

"Soma was a definite 10/10 for me. God what an incredible story game. So morbidly fascinating I still think about it at least once a week. The atmosphere was so amazing, the literal thousands of tons of pressure pushing in on you at every second you’re wandering around that sea base. You can actually almost feel it. It’s not super gameplay orientated though and probably that’s why it’s so overlooked.",
"Yakuza 0 is probably a rare videogame 10/10 for me. The story is loaded and very plot-heavy with a gradually developing spiderweb of events, the voice-acting is amazing, the action is fast and wonderfully violent, the music goes incredibly hard both in combat and in the famous karaoke minigame, the minigames are each unique from the other and are numerous, and the writing is funny, impactful, and overall fantastic, arguably some of the best in gaming for me, making the substories extremely worthwhile, especially since they somehow handle wacky bonkers humor extremely well alongside the serious, dramatic, and very differently toned story.
However, it is very long (though that wasn't a problem for me because of the story), can be clunky at times with using the menus and sometimes the camera, and is the most unfriendly game I have ever played for completionists. You will not have fun if you are playing for the achievements.
Thinking more about it, another 10/10 game for me is also The Pedestrian. I wish I dedicated the comment to that game now because I think there are literally zero flaws with it, but oh well, it doesn't take away from Yakuza 0.",
"Nintendo the real winner of the console wars, look at those 10's",
I'll throw Baldur's Gate 2 in the conversation.  It is one of the best RPGs of all time and it still holds up,
That half life 2 take has gotta be one of the biggest Atrioc L's,
GTA San Andreas has worse gun sounds than Half Life 2,

"Those Half-Life 2 sounds really are iconic now, though. And undoubtedly the ambient noise in Half-Life 2 remains some of the best in video-games




EDIT: Also this whole comment section is sleeping madly on The Witcher 3. Yes, I know it's the most circle-jerked game out there, but goddamn is that a 10/10 game",
"I have to agree with Big A on his HL2 take. I absolutely loved HL1 when I first decided to play it in 2017, and started the sequel right after. 

Idk if I even made it through half of HL2 before never touching it again. I just didn't find it as engaging as the first game.",
"""Survive one minute into the video with your sanity 2022 challenge""",

Don’t forget bloons😧,
"lmao as for league, i hate it personally, but been playing for around 10 years.

its a toxic game by design, it's never gonna be healthy, balanced, or a fun game. ever


but still, having said that, nobody can say it's a bad game. mechanics are fleshed out, movement is smooth, animations are crispy, nothing really feels clunky (at least for long), and in general comparing to other mobas, it's one of the best in terms of playing experience (specially comparing to the pain that is playing dota 2 lmao).
on the other hand, it's definitely not a 10/10 game. huge solo queue / pro play discrepancies which fucks the whole game's balance, whole classes being useless, broken champs being used in not the intended lanes, and just in general the gold mechanic is always gonna make league a not competitive game when it comes to soloing",
"Play HL2 again, no balls",
Please play god of war bro,
How did no one mention Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow?!,
I am being 100% serious: The Lego Star Wars Complete Saga is a perfect 10/10,
"I know everyone who plays Outer Wilds loves it, a potential 10/10 game?",
I’d personally disagree on the hollow knight being better than any other Metroidvania it’s a good metroidvania but I think people overrate it I much prefer a game like blasphemous or Metroid dread as I find the gameplay experience and fights more fun,
"I actually love the sound of the pistol in HL2. One of my favorite gun sounds from any game. POP POP POP. It just sounded so different from what I was used to at the time and kinda still hits different. Half-life 2 has always been one of my all-time favorites, but the original, and especially the Black Mesa remake are goated. Definitely agree with Sekiro and Hades. Some God of War and Resident Evil titles would be on my list as well.",
"“OOT made every PS1 RPG look like shit”

Ngl almost every zelda game is close to a 9 or 10 especially breath of the wild given how good it is and just how many players it introduced to other zelda games,
"Doom 1993 is my 10/10, amazingly fun to this day. I really enjoy Fallout NV for the writing and atmosphere, I'm addicted to the feeling of playing through the Mojave, so it's subjectively 10/10, but objectively it has technical issues.",
"HL2: Episode 1&2 more so than HL2 itself.
Homeworld, now that's where it's at",
"I definitely think OoT is a 10. Where there are better games than OoT, I genuinely can't think of a single thing about the entire game that I actually dislike, or even think isn't good. It's literally just perfect",
For me my two ten out of ten are most probably breath of the wild and minecraft. Dark souls 1 is almost perfect but blighttown and the camera lower it to like 9/10.,
"Halo Reaches campaign is really good IMO,  My favorite memories from Console days are Halo Reach and Black ops 2 both in my opinion are Peak video games though modern warfare(2019) really showed me what new generation of games could look like.",

"GTA 5 is definitely a 10/10 in my book. I don't really count GTA Online as part of GTA 5 itself, so that probably plays into it. I just think that the sheer scope, beauty, and story of GTA 5 makes it a definitive 10/10.",
RED DEAD REDEMPTION MAN COME ON,
I actually agree with this list pretty much is very similar to mine.,
Kinda crazy how we did not see smite on this because it is the most fun moba and not toxic whatsoever 😁.,

"Many people unfortunately leave it at one playthrough despite the game out right telling them not to, but I'm fully convinced NieR: Automata is the greatest game ever made for a multitude of reasons.

Combat is smooth and satisfying, the pinnacle of Platinum Games' formula. Heavy weapons are weighty, light weapons are floaty, and everything just fits so perfectly.

The story is emotional and engaging, keeping its somber tone throughout while excellently injecting some elements of humor and kindness to keep it from being a complete downer throughout. The several messages it conveys to the player are easy to understand, allowing the average player to engage with it, while deep enough to encourage a deeper discussion with it.

The music, it's stand-out feature to many, is absolutely beautiful, the second best OST ever made for a video game, only being narrowly beaten out by its predecessor, NieR.

Although it doesn't have the sharpest graphics, the vistas it creates and how they're presented to the player is simply amazing. Encountering the Amusment Park for the first time, running through the abandoned city with the oddly melancholic music accompanying you, and the end credits scene are all breathtaking experiences.

It isn't a perfect game, but I think it's the best ever made, and thus, a 10/10.",
"I saw a lot of rocket league in the chat, and I think out of online multiplayer games if you were to give one a 10/10 that would probably be it. Gameplay is totally great, the sound design is pretty awesome and the endless customization is insane.",
"if mario 64 was released today with the better graphics, same shitty camera, and thr same level design it wouldnt be too popular. i feel like a good chunk of the magic was because it wss mario",
anyone notice the kid who just found out who dunkey is spamming his knack video in chat lol,
"To the chatters saying tony hawks underground 2 is a 10/10, I respect you",
Mario 64's camera is dogshit,
"My big 10/10 game is Star Control 2. Sure, it's old - older than I am, even - but the story, the aliens, and the arcade mode are all perfectly done. If you haven't played it (or, y'know, heard of it) I highly recommend giving it a try. I believe you can still get it for free under the name ""Ur-Quan Masters.""",
"I’m currently playing Pokémon blue on my 3DS, and I can’t believe how addicting it is.",
"Best game is Vampire Survivors, best 3$ I've ever spent",
Age of Empires 2 is 10/10,
RDR2 is one of the top games of all time and I’m surprised I haven’t seen other people saying that. For sure 10/10,
Red Dead Redemption 2 is definately up there.,
RED DEAD REDEMPTION 2,
"So many people talking about ori in chat, and seriously to anyone who reads this; if you are interested in 2d indie shit, for the love of god play “Ori and the Blind Forest” and “Celeste”.",
lol unsubbing for this shitty hl2 take,
Mario is a stupid man with a hat jumping whilst making stupid noises. My foetus' foetuses would feel childish playing a mario game.,
"Have to disagree, Half Life 2, 10/10",
"I cant imagine not having CS:GO on this list. CS:GO is a perfect shooter game. 100% skill based, you cant buy a skin or item that makes you better or gives you any advantage. There's nothing so OP that it cant be used in competitive play. It's a game that came out in 2012 and is still relevant 10 years later, with massive prize pools in esports. It is a pure test of your aiming skill, which is hard to come by nowadays. I have way too many hours on CS, so I may be a tad biased, but besides Halo 3 and Minecraft, It may be the best game ever made. (Coming from the prospective of a massive FPS fan)",
Disco elysium easily 10/10,
League is a 10/10 game for like the first couple hundred games and then it becomes a 1/10,
Can’t wait to see the coin base sponsor tomorrow Big A. Public WH OMEGALUL,
"half-life 2 includes Garry's mod in my book and that makes it a 10/10, just say your opinion not why you think others are wrong.",
"I agree with every one. I'd add Bloodborne, Slay the Spire, NieR:Automata, BOTW, Cry of Fear and Mario Strikers Charged.",
"the fact that ""Lego Star Wars: The Complete Saga"" was never mentioned is so disrespectful. you just lost a fan big A",
MR GLIZZY IS BACK!,
wow,
thumbtack only real 10/10 game,
"I genuinely believe that Yoshi’s Island on the SNES is the closest game to being considered absolutely perfect. Many of its cons (Easy bosses, difficulty spikes, annoying crying from Baby Mario) can be excused when considering how it’s meant to ease someone new into the gaming scene. And it’s pros (awesome soundtrack, consistently fun gameplay, great art style) are nearly unmatched in any other game I’ve personally played/seen",
"Greatest game ever…… hands down, a 100/10

Wait for it.

Twisted Metal.

Followed by the number two game ever made

Wait for it


Wait for it



Crazy taxi",
Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3 are both 10/10 worthy,
Earliest ive ever been to a big a vid,
"8:47 uglier sure, but you can't really tell me OOT music is just better than FF music",
I had the opposite situation where all my friends had N64 and goldeneye. Something PS1 had that was super dope was a version of Diablo that could be played co-op locally on the console. Suuuper fun to play back in the day with a friend.,
Black ops 2. 11/10 I could play that now and it's still the most fun cod,
"Some games i'd put as 10/10s:

- Undertale
- Uncharted 1 & 4 (i love them both so dearly i can't find it in me to say either is worse)
- Jedi fallen order
- Fallout: new vegas",
"Look, you're not allowed to give the thumbtack a 10/10 since you said games aren't supposed to cause you physical pain. Either the thumbtack isn't a 10/10, or LoL is: pick your hill to die on.",
Bruh outer wilds,
league of legends looks like trash now adays and the UI its gross af might aswell just be a chinese rip off game,
I can't believe Atrioc left out the best game ever! That of course being Knack.,
PlayStation 1 had more 10/10 games than any console or era,
"Unironically I view Paper Mario as a 10/10... so long as it's followed by "": The Thousand Year Door"".",
"it's kinda amazing you guys are arguing about all this without mentioning rock paper scizzors, truly a game ahead of its time. It has been in use for an incredibly long time and is still basically untouched by anything.",
"CSGO is not perfect for everyone, but it is a perfect version of what it wants to be in my opinion",
Assassins creed 1 - revelations,
"Celeste is a 10/10 hands down. Its pixel animation, soundtrack, gameplay physics, game mechanics, story, all immaculate.

Hollow knight is a 9.9/10 for me. The game is fantastic, i only wish some of the areas of the game felt more varied, like the forgotten crossroads, ancient basin and kingdoms edge feel very similar (though still great and fleshed out).

Undertale is a hard one for me, because the characters and story is a 20/10, and the soundtrack slaps. My only gripe with the game is the battle system, which (unlike deltarune) is slightly repetitive, but the interactions with those characters during fights is still great. I think it still has to be a 10/10. 

God of war (new one, cuz i havent played the originals), smash bros melee, minecraft, super mario 64, omori, deltarune (so far) are all also 10/10s for me.
Also, fortnite in its prime was 10/10, but overall it falls below that.
Finally, deaths door (a game i assume not many have heard of) is a contender for 10/10. Its artstyle and music is great, with great combat mechanics and unique POI’s. Feel like a few aspects of it may draw it back tho.
Theres many other 10/10 games out there, i just havent played them yet.",
damn no cuphead,
only multiplayer game I could give a 10 to is osrs (:,
anyone got the song at 3:31?,
Resident evil came out in 1996 and the controls in Mario 64 are fucking ass so bad that I didn’t complete the first area,
Pokémon platinum is probably the best game of all time,
"maybe Kotor doesnt look very good anymore, but I really truly think it's still a 10/10. Story? Banger. Characters? Extremely well developed for how many there were, more so then but still strong now. Music? Slaps. Mechanics? I mean come on any game that successfully remakes the old DnD system into a video game is amazing. Setting? There's shit in that game that I would say are 100x cooler than anywhere the new SW movies go. 

Anyways KOTOR and Fable the original are two of my GOAT games and I'll never stop touting their legend.",
it sucks that we'll never know if atriocracing is a 10/10 due to the thumbtack attack of 2022,
CSGO 1.6,
"Red Dead Redemption 2 is always gonna be a 10/10 imo from the small details in the game to the amazing story and characters, and that’s honestly only a fraction of the things that make it phenomenal",
"The tiroc Gambino
Edit: no I have not watched the video",
elite marketing by Big A by clickbaiting me with pokemon in the thumbnail,
Subnautica,
"Been saying this forever
Halo 2: best campaign 
Halo 3: best multiplayer",
"rocket league, 10/10",
Terraria is definitely a 10/10,
Hitman would be a 10/10. But haven holy fuck. Getting seen through 100 different entities and props from across the map. Yikes,
"haven't played a lot of games mentioned by people here, but OMORI takes the cake for me. It's a game of a lifetime, and the way it deals with trauma (one of the main topics) is so beautiful. I hope everyone gives it a try!",
"It's been memed a lot but Undertale is a 10/10 for me, going in completely blind and not knowing what to expect, it's one of the most memorable gaming experiences I ever had",
"Banjo-Kazooie will always be a #1 10/10 for me there’s no other game for me that truly has a feeling that Banjo-Kazooie has where you’re playing through a saturday morning cartoon. The level design is tight, the difficulty ramps up perfectly as you play, and all of the character interactions and dialogue never get old. Truly a timeless masterpiece for platformers after SM64",
Mario Kart Wii 🤌,
"Halo 2 is far from 10/10 just because of legendary. Ttk is way too low, and repetitive levels.  The game went through an infamous development, so it's amazing that it turned out as well as it did though.",
Persona 5,
Live streams is a waste of content it's just talking,
God of War 2018 is probably my favorite game of all time. It's the first game I ever strived to 100% because the world was so big and I loved how every location in the game was deep and rich with lore regarding norse mythology. The only gripe I had was boss fights were repetitive since most were just the reskinned trolls but the first fight against The Stranger and the Magni and Modi fight were very interesting and made me fall in love with the game.,
"Atrioc what about Chess? It was thousands of years ahead of its time. Great graphics, great music, great storyline, a truly 10/10 game.",
"I truly think Minecraft, with the pure amount of creativity that is behind that game and the infinite things you can achieve, is the perfect game. Still played today by millions upon millions, and one of the most speedrun games. I have been playing for years and don't see myself quitting, especially with the amount of servers and gamemodes I can play.",
"FOR GOODNESS SAKE ATRIOC PLAY OUTER WILDS.

PEAK EXAMPLE OF A 10/10 MYSTERY AND PUZZLE GAME, GREAT DIALOGUE AND OUTSTANDING SETPIECES. YOUR CHAT WAS TELLING YOU ABOUT IT.",
"im clicking off the video after saying hl2 isn't 10/10. To keep it blunt think about all the other games that used its assets, and the games created with it. WTF",
"Sekiro is my 10/10 perfect game. It has incredible level design, with an added level of verticality from previous from soft games. The game looks beautiful. The combat is the most fluid combat I have ever played in a videogame. When you get it down it feels like a dance. It has really good replayability and very good endgame content. Sword Saint Isshin and Inner Owl are some of the best bossfights in videogames. The only complaint I have ever had about the game is that the grab attacks are sometimes bs.",
Hollow knight for sure,
Hey big atrioc would you be interested in playing more RTS type games? I was just rewatching the backlog and the Age of Empires video was really fun to watch!,
Subnautica is easily a 10/10 game for me. I wish I could play it again completely blind.,
"Recently I think that Omori is a 10/10 for me. The art is so adorable and so horrifying at the same time, the soundtrack is full of bangers, and gameplay made so much sense with the characters and story. I never had a game give me such an emotional rollercoaster where I was even thinking about it in the middle of the night.",
Celeste?,
"Honestly gotta disagree on the Minecraft. It has some serious progression flaws, and tedium. I love minecraft, don't get me wrong, but there's definitely some shit parts of that game.",
The last of us is 10/10,
Binding of isaac rebirth,
freaking love Hades,
"My 10/10s are Pokémon Black/White 2, Enter the Gungeon, Titanfall 2, Minecraft, and Destiny 1/2 at points",
Titanfall 2 Campaign though?,
"hl2 isnt a 10 but portal2 is a 10??? either both are, or they are both nines.  pokemon red and blue are 10s, they literally just repackage that game every few years, people know it and people still buy it.",
How did you not mention Paper Mario and the Origami King. I am in shock and total disarray that you never even brought it up. You should be ashamed of yourself for your actions. Smh I thought you were better than this. 😔,
Wow u didn't even talk about MGS,
"For me, the only game I’d say is the closest game to perfection is Final Fantasy 9.

Top tier story, top tier music, top tier characters, probably the best ATB game I’ve played but ATB still kinda sucks, top tier top tier",
The only game I have in mind is Shadow of the Colossus,
"Imo a solid 11 for me are Xenogears and Xenoblade Definitive Edition (remaster), i could be hours here explaining why, but all im going to say is that those games present a narrative different from any other game i have ever played, just play it, especially now that Xenoblade 3 us coming to present the ending of the Perfect Works story",
Black Ops 2 has to be a 10/10 at least in multiplayer terms,
"Mass Effect 2 is a 10/10 I think. My personal favourite game is Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, but there are enough design issues, even with the unofficial patch, that I cannot give it a 10/10 in good conscience. It gets carried so hard on atmosphere, though.",
2:08 someone in chat said Plants vs Zombies and they are correct,
This video definitely gets a 10/10 for the editing.,
"I'm sorry, but HL2 is 10/10. There is no debate here.",
"True 10/10’s imo are Final Fantasy X, Crysis, Left 4 Dead 1/2, Mass Effect 2, Mario 64, Bioshock, GTA 5, Skyrim and Halo 2/3. I could go on but this list would go on for a long time lol",
Mario Super Sluggers 10/10 nothing is better than playing baseball as Donkey Kong batting with a boxing glove,
I want to give pretty much every Xenoblade game a 10/10 (even the ones not in the main series like Xenogears and saga). I might be biased but they are some of the only games I have ever played that I could actually do another playthrough and even cried during the story in most of them.,
"I know this take has been overdone recently, but Titanfall 2 has to be one of the best feeling games I've ever played. It was like using herione for the first time and not being able to go back to meth.",
Paper Mario thousand year door will still forever have that place in my heart as the perfect turn based game,
fallout new vegas,
"I was blind but now I see, playing with thumbtacks was made for me",
"I have only rated 2 games 10/10. Celeste (despite Atriocs hate) and Ori and the will of the wisps
Edit: (and the cuphead DLC)",
Bloodborne. The only game that came easily to mind.,
"Pretty solid list, although I think that there is quite a few games missing, it’d take absolute ages to go through all of them. Also MM gang rise up. OOT is definitely a 10/10 but MM is such a different game with the same style. Everything feels relevant and polished and you always have that impending doom everywhere you go. Idk that game just makes you.. feel.",
"Nothing on this list but Atrio, calling it rn.",
Red Dead Redemption 2,
Think doom ethereal was/is a amazing game like around a 9/10 / 8/10.,
"Calling it rn, Big A thinks that Half Life 2 is a 10 out of 10!!!!",
Halo 3,
Its hard for me to give hitman a singular score bc the maps can range from amazing to haven,
"The only games I've rated 10/10 in the last few years are Hades, Elden Ring, Marvel's Spider-Man, Celeste, Hollow Knight, BOTW, and Shovel Knight TT.",
Mario 64 is pretty ugly. Spyro came out only 2 years later on the PlayStation which wasn’t as powerful and that game looks way nicer,
Cant believe rdr2 wasn’t even mentioned :(,
the differance between a 10 / 10 and a 5 / 10 is skill based matchmaking,
"When was the last time halo 2 stans played that campaign? Literally every levels is a ""Hold your ground"". Half the time, you're jumping around in circle waiting for them to spawn.",
"I got some of my own subjective 10/10s, most of these are gonna be on the newer side not gonna be in any order
1. Katana ZERO. I think this game might genuinely be perfect, it's like... just right. It has great action, a haunting story, and tons of replay value. Granted I didn't give it 100 hours or anything like that but for a game that can be beaten in 15 mins I gave it like 16 hours of my life just playing it for fun so that's gotta count for something
2. Rimworld. This game is dangerously close to being the best video game of all time the more I think about it, Rimworld is endlessly, genuinely endlessly replayable. I have like 300 hours and I've never beaten it, not that I really think it's meant to be beaten, this game is a story generator and damn is it a good story generator. Yes you can win, but I never really saw the goal mattering as much as how you get there and the stories you can tell about what you did and how you did it.
3. Pokemon black 2. Pokemon games are inherently flawed because of a million different reasons but this game? It's probably the best pokemon game out there I've replayed it to completion five times in my life and that's more than can be said about like every other game I've played.
4. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. This game is my childhood game, this game is my perfect game, and if you asked me what my number 1 personal favorite game is it's this one. The newer MH games are phenomenal, but nothing ever comes close to this game. It's a game I am truly, genuinely in love with

As for some I think are close, but not quite there yet for one reason or another
1. Hollow Knight - It's almost there, but I just haven't beaten it yet. I cannot finish the last coliseum but nothing ever will match the feeling I got playing it for the first time, just wow. Losing to the coliseum of fools definitely has made me a lil salty tho gonna admit hahaha
2. Skullgirls - I'm gonna give this game kudos wherever, whenever, it needs it man. Also I just love the game
3. Crusader Kings 3 - Almost. It just needs more content to be 10/10
4. Stellaris - It doesn't need more content I just need to play it more, but I think strategy games like this just inherently can't be 10/10s because of how fast I burn out and can't finish them",
"Surely if we're talking about small, self-contained experiences that achieve exactly what they set out to do, we have to mention Journey. 10/10",
Pokémon?,
There is no objectively 10/10 game since to be a 10/10 game it would have to be completely perfect game and that’s impossible since everyone have different tastes,
"Subnautica: Abandon Ship, best Soundtrack change my mind.

Soundtrack: https://youtu.be/nf30qQzw7rk",

has atrioc played outer wilds?,
"For me, Factorio, Celeste, Stardew, Baba is You, and Sonic Mania are 10/10s.",
"Borderlands 2, some of the Yakuza games and most of the Monster Hunter games are perfect 10s imo",
"Mario Odyssey, Ori 2, BOTW, Smash Ultimate, Cuphead, Mariokart 8",
"For JRPGs I'd say Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door, Kingdom Hearts 2, Xenoblade Chronicles, and maybe Final Fantasy VII are the 10/10s that come to mind.",
Go play outer wilds don't look at spoilers. Best game ever made potentially minus a couple porbis,
"22 seconds in and we already have a horrible take, always delivering Big A",
Thumbtack 10/10?,
honestly kinda sad that Nier Automata wasent mentioned since it was probably the best game i had played till now,
Trash take A. 2004. Fresh source engine. If you dont consider it a 10/10 you didnt play it when it dropped. It made portal. Figure it out.,
"Someone said it in chat, but Spiderman 1&2 for PS4 were both amazing in every aspect. Sounds, beauty in the environment, amazing storyline and villains, stealth missions, side quests, cool skins, and most of all the satisfying swinging and fighting controls. That is a perfect game in my opinion

Every time I’ve ever played it my only complaint was that I wished it was longer",
Sonic adventure 2 battle?,
Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) is a 10 out of 10 to me. It is one of the only games that I can consistently go and do a 100% run of every few months,
"Puzzle - Portal 1 (duh)
Fighting - Melee (sorry fgc)
Sports - Rocket League (LOL)
Shooter - TF2
Strategy/City Builder - Dwarf Fortress
Platformer - Mario 64
Minecraft is a 10/10 too it doesnt have a category",
"Most recent game i might call a 10/10 was half life Alyx, the atmosphere in tbe half life universe was an amazing experience",
these are all literally 7s or 8s at best,
9/10 video,
The take on PS1 RPGs is pretty hot lol I'm sure FF7 fans would have something to say,
"There is one game that legend says is so rare, so pure, so divine, so mind breaking and world altering that it can only be played one time a year on a fair May night. That seems to be notably omitted here",
Minecraft is 10/10. I don't even like the game that much. You can create machines/builds far beyond the scope and imagination of the creators of the game. Infinite content/fun only limited by imagination.,
Mario Odyssey 10/10,
Warcraft 3 was a 10/10 game until they reforged it.,
Video about perfect 10's yet NO mention of red dead redemption 2? insanity,
Never owned anything Nintendo. I had to go to McDonald’s to play Super Mario 64 back when they had those video games in the play area 😂,
"The tetris series of games atleast needs to be in this conversation, Tetris is the only series of games in the world where i can pick up practically any version of it and just play for hours without getting bored. The core gameplay is amazing and extremely easy so much so that anyone can play it, but at the same time the depth of the gameplay is still deep enough that you can play for hundreds of hours and still be getting better, you need to learn to play at speed, how the rotating system works, what random setups you can use to abuse said rotating system, what gets you the most points in what situation, all of that shit. As well as the music, the original tetris theme is probably one of my favourite video game themes, and then you have tetris effect which if you are gonna choose one game as a 10/10 for the tetris series it would have to be that, its got the zone power for a buit of extra gameplay that keeps it fresh if you have already played tetris a bunch, and thent he music and visuals are top-tier for any videogame.",
"i have no connection to half life at all. but hearing atrioc call half life 2 ""forgettable"" is so funny. its like the 1 game i hear everyone suck on lol",
the first game that came to mind is titan fall 2:) (campaign is amazing and multiplayer is still really fun),
hes forgetting bloons!!!,
i like nier automata,
I saw my boys in chat spreading the gospel of Outer Wilds,
Half life 2 is bad because of a minor pistol sound effect that isnt even that had 😎,
"Titanfall 2 10/10. absolutely goated, abandoned by EA",
Mgs 1,
"Persona 5 is a 10/10. The characters, the music, the style, the gameplay it's just perfect, it also invented jazz so that's a plus",
I think Breath Of The Wild is a solid like 8/10 or 9/10 I dont think its a 10/10 because I don't think it will hold up against more open world games that come out now that game developers know well done open world games work such as Elden Ring. Of course that's just my opinion,
"There's no way you can say minecraft is ahead of its time, it's just a bunch of blocks",
Bloodborne.,
"Like one guy said in chat, shadow of the colossus, is a perfect game, the sound, the scale, the lore, the graphics, the creatures, the immersion of feeling terrible for killing these ageless beautiful beasts but knowing you have to continue despite that they do nothing except be hunted and so they fight back. One of the greatest games ever",
Tony hawk pro skater 3 was always my favorite TH game and certainly a 10/10 from me,
an entire perfect game video without mentioning God of War is criminal,
"Castle Crashers has a humor of the early internet, fart jokes n all, but it's one of those games I happily replay with my friends again and again. Easy 10/10 pls Behemoth give us Castle Crashers 2",
ape escape 2 is a perfect ten.,
"I think it's totally fair to say that HL2 is not a 10/10 game, it was just really important for it's time and has a great plot.  That being said, I think Atrioc is doing to Minecraft what he complained about people doing to HL2.  I'm a huge Minecraft fan but the game is not and has at no point been 10/10, it's just had a lot of cultural impact and is a really impressive game.  The flaws of minecraft are kinda glaring and a lot of them will never get fixed at this point.  I think it's almost unfair to even include it in the list because Minecraft is so much more of a platform or game engine than an actual videogame itself.  The hoards of kids who play minecraft aren't playing vanilla survival, they're all playing on servers that are modded to hell to make it an entirely new game",
"I think we all know that atrioc thinks that BTD6 is also a 10/10, he was just too afraid to admit it",
"Titanfall 2 is the best fps game of the last 10 years.
The pvp is great, the movement is the best of its kind and the story is amazing, modern fps games cant even compete.",
Cyberpunk is truly one of the games of all time,
"Bro RE4 was a game I was thinking about from the start of the vid. Hoesntly, there were so many good games from that era. DMC3 was legit as well.",
I'm gonna say Ocarina and Majora's are FAR from being 10/10s. Like insanely far. My reasoning is perfectly explained if you watch Sequelitis - ZELDA: A Link to the Past vs. Ocarina of Time by Egoraptor. My opinion was not blindly shaped by this video. This video just perfectly reflects my exact feelings and thoughts about the game,
"Frog fractions 10/10 game, you could not change my mind",
Halo combat evolved OG perfect game,
"My top 5 games of all time and games I’d consider 9-10s would be uncharted 2, arkham city, elden ring, minecraft and bo2",
Titanfall 2 is perfect. I will take no other opinions.,
Celeste is a 10/10 tbh,
"in all honesty bloodborne is a 10/10 in every aspect. The story, lore, world, gameplay, bosses, music, sound design, graphics literally everything is perfect and holds up today",
I think castle crashers is a 10/10. The best side scroller ever made,
"i think outer wilds is up there with one of the greats exceptionally with the DLC. the sound, the mystery and the lore is awesome and the map is i think the best map of a game ever made",
katana zero for me perferct soundtrack and sound the lore and the story secrets sword secret boss etc u just don't get bored of it because the game forces you to think diffrently you just can brute force your way through and the dialouges with the therapist actually make a diffrence you can finish a stage with 2 options you can kill everyone or get out without killing anybody and the game isn't even that long its 4 hours for the first playthrough and if you want to get diffrent sword after you beat the game theres a tv that you can select diffrent stages so you don't start the game over and over again to get the secret swords and the secret boss. i love that game,
the question on everyone’s minds,
"Personally I’d have to go with dishonored, a decade old and holds up so fucking well. Great replay ability and great dlc. Sequel is good too but doesn’t scratch the itch the original does",
unsubbed for hl2 hate,
"Inscryption, the first time through, fucking love that game. The twists and turns, the fun game play, the fact they were basically forced to make it a rogueluke because of all the fun card stuff people wanted repeated, it's in my top 10. The charm is unmatched. Super biased but it's one of my favorite games I've ever played",
When you made the comments about league causing physical pain and the black tar heroin joke I cackled so god damn loud. Great video.,
pokémon emerald kinda 10/10 based and peepo,
release the dunkey cut >:(,
It takes two is a 10,
Gran Turismo,
If that thumbtack isnt an allegory for the league of legends experience I don't know what is...,
"I found Majoras Mask more fun but Ocarina of Time more of an adventure.

Edit: kotor was kinda meh",
"Shovel Knight, Botw, Pikmin 3 are 10s for me",
"I don’t know if it’s allowed but Minecraft with mods is 10/10, but vanilla isn’t…",
"Resident evil 4 Is one of my favorite games. I don't even mind buying it 8 times now. It feels so good, I love the characters. The world looks so good while also being grim. There's humor, horror, action, serious moments, stakes, whacky quick time events. Absolutely weird controls. And it all works",
phantom dust a 10/10,
"Axiom verge and Unepic, perhaps quake 1. Diablo 1 for sure, brood war.",
Deep rock galactic and terraria are both 10/10,
"Only games I give a 10/10 are Doom 1993, Resident Evil 2 (2019) Resident Evil 4, Danganronpa:Trigger Happy Havoc, Minecraft and probably Cuphead and fallout new Vegas",
Last of us 2 10/10,
Conker's Bad Fur Day for N64 is an easy 10/10,
Witcher 3,
"I think I would consider StarCraft 2 a 10/10 such a great game with such a great story, and it even gets sprinkled with some of the best ingame cinematics I’ve ever seen. Every time I play an rts I think to myself I wish I was playing StarCraft.. it seems like StarCraft was so good it killed its own genre",
no one ever talks about undertale,
Subnautica has some of the best sound design ever.,
Ori and the blind forest was a banger,
"""Atrioc Racing 2"" will be an instant 10/10 once it releases",
7:51 Rest in peace technoblade,
Half life 2 is a 10 out of 10,
"Here's my list of ""Perfect"" games:

- Dark Souls 1 if it was only the first half
- Bloodborne if it was 60fps
- BOTW, minus the dungeons, story, bosses, and required objectives
- Katamari Damacy",
RDR2 is 10/10,
"My mother will always be a 10 in my heart, Yes Atrioc!",
I’d say my 10/10 is outer wilds,
"atrioc's Gamer Takes are based 

skyrim? mid. half life 2? mid. sekiro? 10/10. this guy knows what hes talking about",
"I saw it in a chat a couple times, but Chrono Trigger is an absolute masterpiece",
Bro alien isolation,
"No sekiro, but outer is definitely ou there",
castle crashers and battleblock theater !!!,
"Can anyone tell me how black ops 2 isn’t a 10/10? Addictive and rewarding intuitive Multiplayer, a fucking fuck exiting and engaging campaign, and the best zombies game mode created since then. Has to be.",
Paper Mario is 10/10,
"celeste, hollow knight, and outer wilds might be my only 10/10 games… Metroid dread is pretty damn close too but I haven’t finished it quite yet but it’s one of the most polished Nintendo games I’ve played in recent memory for today’s standards.",
the console wars is the one war Big A actually served in,
Realm Royale is a perfect 10/10,
How you gonna say you like tight short games then say hollow knight is a 10... That shit is the opposite of short and sweet.,
Mies leading thumbnail :(,
1HE GIVES HADES A 10/10 AND NOT SKYRIM this dude is off his rocker holy shit,
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky is also definitely a 10/10 game. The storytelling and pacing of that game is so amazing. Some sick plot-twists as well.,
Inside is a 10,
I think as far as RPGs go Dragon Age: Origins is a 10/10 and probably the best western RPG ever made. It doesn’t miss on any aspect of the genre and is innovative in a lot of ways games weren’t at the time. I think it gets forgotten because the sequel was a 2/10 and the third one was a 5-6/10,
Boomer take ngl,
In my opinion Minecraft can’t be a 10/10 because of how reliant it is on looking things up. Without google the game kinda blows,
"Out of all of the games I have ever played, nothing compares to Team Fortress 2 and Terraria, both of which deserve 10/10s.",
Breath of the wild but I don’t want a 10/10 I want the speed run competition between atrioc stanz and Ludwig. They have all worked on tech,
Imagine believing anything this man says after he stabs himself with a thumbtack he was playing with 💀,
yo Big A what is this video out of 10?,
"I'll die on this hill... sekiro is far from a 10/10. Compared to other souls like games the combat is repetitive, bosses are repetitive, the music is great for an hour then ur over it... no customization features compared to 90% of games. It's a good game but lackluster in the end",
cuphead,
based sm64 take,
Titanfall2 had always been the best FPS game for me. No other game has had that quality of gameplay and a banger campaign with it,
Good opinions and great vid ty zinjo,
The first dishonored game was def a 10/10 for me. Plus the story is even more relatable now since the pandemic started,
"I have hundreds of hours in minecraft, but I think I wouldn't rate it a 10. There just isn't ENOUGH. There's barely anything interesting to find through exploration. Terraria did it better, and I'd only barely rate terraria a 10. Minecraft's multiplayer is significantly better, but the lack of content is a major hurdle.",
Hey atrioc what does it take to get a like from you?,
"Forgot Paper Mario, classic mistake",
what?!?,
I was not ready for him stabbing himself,
I love the sound of falling onto a window in Manifold Garden. Satisfying and I went out of my way to do it repeatedly,
Fallout NV gotta be my GOAT game if i really had to pick,

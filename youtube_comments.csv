Cats can eat grass it helps them when there stomach hurts badly,
I can't wait for Part 2 on this :D look's awesome and adorable the same time,
"Its okay about the poncho Jack, you return to the area after that tranceiver mission",
Jack you forgot to find the first few memory slots in your record tab that your robit cat AI needs,
"I really hope Jack plays Sky some day, I really think he would like it and love to explore the beautiful world, please do I would love to see it❤️",
I wish to see more episode. Need coffee.,
Warrior cat vibes anyone?,
Hey Jack I have a song for you it is called Valhalla calling by miracle of sound,
"Jack: ""What is going through cats heads when they knock stuff over?""
Also Jack: *proceeds to knock every paint can over*",
This cats level of intelligence is quite astounding considering he is orange.,
This is how my grandpa described his way to school back in the day.,
oh god knowing the ending hurts....,
Its the cat of Nathan Drake LOL,
Yes i wanted to see you play this so badly❤❤❤,
Anyone else notice how Jack plays with his fingers a lot now? It’s ADORABLE 🥰🥰,
Let's f ing go,
The music reminds me of oneshot for some reason,
Just my thought but maybe why most signs are unreadable it may be showing how cats can’t read lol 😂 not fact just my take on it,
Morrrrrrrrrree plz,
If the days thing is divided by 365 you get ~7 million years since a start point but we don't know what that start is the latest potential year this game is in the 9927 give or take some years.,
I want this to be a movie,
"You should watch Felidae (1994), it’s an animated film about intelligent cats with a twist ending (warning: adult horror)",
Cats are the most precious thing to me and 5 minutes in and i know im gonna call them cute with jack every ten seconds,
Bruh why so many ad on this one,
I'm in love with this game now,
"Game developers: we made a game where you play as a cat.
The entire internet: shut up and take my money. 😸😸😸",
I need more of this !!!,
I think humans did experiments with the cats long ago and made the cats super smart,
"when Sean started meowing in the game my cat came up, this game calls them all!!",
"I started playing yesterday and I love it so much, I've already gotten 33% of the achievements.
I named the cat Macaroni",
idk why jack keeps on knocking over the paint cans but I hope this will be a series,
"Jack: ""why is there a cat standing in front of an ominous red door?""
Me: ""foreshadowing""😂",
I kept seeing ads for this game on steam and I was waiting for a specific happy go lucky Irishman to play it,
"Man that cat sure is super acroCATic XD
I'll stop ;-; 
Actually no I won't, that was funny lol",
"""youre a robot and you don't speak robot"" imagine not understanding a language and being told: youre a human and you don't speak human? Jdjdjshsdhshs",
"I absolutely love this :3
I'm just leaving a comment so this video does better and hopefully jack will do a part 2",
"""Natural light that leaked from a star.""

Jack: Woah... So did that infection sort of like, land on an asteroid?

No Jack, they're talking about the sun",
"Considering that it said earth is 4.54 billion years old, this game ""only"" has a buffer of about 1 million years between modern day and the game.",
"YES! orange kitty ""dorobo neko""",
"Jack's reaction encapsulates the protective nature I have over these fuzzballs, been caring for 3 for quite a while,  and I would literally jump in traffic to save them if it came to it.",
valid video,
"Finally a game where robots arent evil and actually helped and cherished humans! This game is adorable, and I absolutely love this kind of retro cyberpunk!",
"Jack: if I were a battery where would be

Battery plugged in the computer: I DoN't KnOw WhErE!?",
My haert,
this game needs a photo grab mode,
I am so emotional right now; I even have a cat with me right now to snuggle!!! 😍😍🐱🐱,
just watched gab play this and yes i'm watching jack play it again. it's just that good of a game! so heartwarming yet terrifying at the same time,
i think the game has a made up language because cats can't read so youre not supposed to know what the signs are saying,
46:23 Man just didn't figure out da text was talking about the sun 💀,
is there a similar game but with dogs?,
I can just imagine BB looking into a camera and trying to grab it,
jack you should play lost in random!!,
46:27 Pretty sure they're just talking about the sun,
"Sean: ""Yeah, can we cut it with the tornado warning? I'm a _cat,_ not a natural disaster!""

Tell that to those poor innocent _paint cans._",
Watching Jack die from cat cuteness is the other cure for sadness,
"Jack: ""I'm a cat not a natural disaster.""
Me: ""Sounds like a cat to me.""",
i have selected this playthrough to watch as i smoke the good stuff and watch cats,
My cat Sam jumped 5 feet in the air and did a flip he's crazy,
this game is cool,
"Thank you for playing this game for me.
I know it's not for me at all but I don't have time for games anymore and I wanted to play this game so much.",
Hey Jack just wanted to say I've been going through a lot this week too! It might be the world right now but I hope things get better for you!,
my face when I realized we weren't getting a tiny cat poncho 🙁,
"Fun Fact: Cats don’t have their own language, they only meow to get their humans attention.",
More,
"When people get hurt in games: 👁️___👁️
When animals get hurt in games: 💧👄💧💔",
"Sean, the message about warm light coming from a star is talking about the sun.",
Apparently there's an app that can translate meows,
"What if humans are alive and they cured the virus, but the virus is still inside the dome where the robots are trapped for years, and the guardians are protecting the dome and keeping the robots inside getting out. Or what if the robots are the virus and they were destroying humans, so they trapped them in where they are being told false information?",
Gato,
1:10:27,
"The part with the quote on the wall about the star leaking on their feet, they actually mean the sun! That's why it also states about it ""helping them grow"" like the plants and everything else. :))",
i feel like dantdm already posted this with the same title and everything,
"25:02 Sean, you had the opportunity to say “my cat is a pussy”, would’ve been cool",
This is so not my type of game.... this game is so on my must have list now... that's what a good let's play can do for a game.,
"We had the Hjönkening 

Then we had the Duckening

Now we have the Cattening.",
wonder if Jack will take a trip to Cat Island one day,
What happened to the until dawn series jack 🤷🏼‍♂️,
"1:35 purrfect
Edit: 44:26 what's up with the person you need in a high mountain or building or anything like that",
"28:58, I love how Jack spends a solid ten seconds asking where the battery was when it was literally right next to him in the camera, and then proceeded to move away anyways. XD",
I am in love with this game,
i’m so so so so happy jack’s playing this. i don’t have the software to play so i appreciate this play through. i’ve been waiting since i saw the trailer in 2021,
"never would’ve thought a game about a cat could be so amazing and i’m not even like a cat lover. also, they made it so real on how cats really are it shocks me.",
Will you play As Dusk Falls? It's a really good telltale-like game,
Sorry Jack I've already watched gab smolders played this :) ♡,
"*cat hanging on the cliff
other cats: ""long live the king""",
"I will die if he doesn't keep playing this 😭😭
He will love the ending so much!",
So this is where my cat hangs out all the time…,
"46:22 it's the sun, Jack. They're talking about the fucking sun.",
Bro the way I started crying after the cat fell 😭 and started limping killed me,
Honestly I feel like a lot of people have been feeling miserable. Idk what it is. Maybe seasonal depression ?,
It’s so funny that what town is just overrun with robot Guinea pigs,
"I’ve been waiting for this game since June last year bro, I’m so hyped",
It's like the first episode of love death + robots,
"once again sean has made me want a game. My wallet will cry again, which isnt a bad thing.",
You missed the saddest part in that little scene of the cat limping if you went back from where you fell you would see the other cats looking down and meowing for you 🥲🥲,
B12 helps with blood and nerves mostly,
is it all fetch quests?,
yes,
The last of puss: meow of the wild,
Not even two minutes in and Jack's already commenting on the lighting. 😂,
Yeesss! Thank you so.much for playing this!!!,
"Most accurate sort of review for this game:

Man jumps around and things break as he falls to his death 40hrs into a game: Serves you right, you dumbass.

Cat becomes mildly inconvenienced 4sec into Stray: …well, now I have to kill everything and everyone until I find out who did this to my beautiful baby, my only reason for living",
The attention to detail in this game is absolutely amazing. 11/10,
BRO IVE WANTED TO PLAY THIS SINCE I SAW THE DEVELOPERS ADVERTISING IT ON TIKTOK,
I love this already and seeing Sean be so attached to the cat is just wholesom. The tick things ick me out tho x.x,
2 minutes i’m already emotional. i would die for this cat.,
I was literally going to comment about how the atmosphere of this game reminds me of journey then jack brought it up 3 minutes later lol,
"2:35 CAT CONGLOMERATE
5:04 is the most accurate statement ever.",
JACK im so sorry i paused it at 15 seconds in because  I wanna play it before i see it... fuck it imma watch anyways,
"If i'm remembering right, I think the devs of this game had (have?) a tiktok where they showed some of the little things you could do and little clips of what they had made so far.  All I remember is it was tiktoks of a very realistic-looking cat game being made and some of the stuff they planned to include.",
Heckin Streeeetchie,
"The environment and gameplay style heavily reminds me of the game Remember Me, so cook",
I don’t know if this has been said but what is the language in the game is just English but because it’s a cat and the cat doesn’t understand English I could be wrong and it’s just some made up alphabet,
"When jack pressed ""O"" to meow, my cat began meowing. She was right next to me when i watched this. 
You got a fan.",
"Jack: *Makes the cat play a symphony on the piano.*

Also Jack: ""Looks like I found the second best cat pianist."" 💖💖💖",
Probably the best tutorial I've ever seen.,
"Aw, I really like this game. I have theories, but I'll wait. It's so interesting. 😊",
CATS,
not me screaming in internal agony as Jack proceeds to stare the 4th battery straight in the face and not see it,
Even after seeing the beginning 4 times it’s still heart wrenching especially since I’m a cat owner also there’s a character that doesn’t have a fat arse that can’t get through the bars,
"9:00 
Long live the king 🦁",
"Jack, i just recently found out that i have tinnitus. I thought id ask you how you deal with yours.",
For the next part please do a cat cam 📷,
this is so tempting to make a diorama,
I saw this trailer a few months back and it looked awesome!! 😁,
Me going this is a lovely game my brain yep just gonna add this to my list of cat related trigger points.,
i finished this game and its amazing i just love it,
"Ooh one of the greatest and loveliest video ever. Thanks for playing  this game. Waiting for another episode. Hopefully you can gift the Ponzio later too. Have a great day there and i hope you will feel better too :) .

Best regards,",
STILL WAITING ON UNTIL DAWN PART 3,
Beans the cat,
"If you liked this you should play Catz on the PS2, I’m sure you’ll love it 😈😂💖",
9:00 I actually cried,
"1:07:29 I never thought I would hear him say ""pocari sweat"", I know a Blue Roo that is really based off of this.",
Came here right after Evelyn's Part 2 upload!,
I really tried to play it. sadly my computer can't run the game and I cried,
"29:42
Cat: meow
Cameras: I agree",
this is that one episode of love death and robots but from the cats pov,
Let's count how many times he missed the battery... I got 7,
I absolutely love the look and feel of this game! The atmosphere is amazing 🤩,
if only i had a PS5....,
"Wait, isn't that poncho made for the cat? Grandma made it and said that it should fit us perfectly so I thought it was for us but maybe I'm wrong?",
"Ok 2 Minutes into the Video and all i have to say is:
""I'll watch it later, i'm gonna get this game first""",
"Cats are such little assholes. It's fucking adorable. I love that this game lets you be a little asshole, knocking shit off ledges and shit",
I knew when I first saw this game that you would be playing it at some point.,
my heart is already breaking on the first 10 mins! this is way I'm not playing it... I'm weak when it comes to animals. but I will watch someone else play it instead lol,
"Cats on the whole would have no problem in a post-apocalyptic world, however, I would trust my rabbit to survive an apocalypse before at least two of my cats. I saw the paint cans and immediately assumed the cat would eat the paint...",
with those weird red things it looks like caelid threw up on midgar LOL,
Me need dog game,
"This game is pointless literally, I get how it can be somewhat enjoyable but it does looks a bit boring, kinda game where if you too baked that’s the game to get on",
there's a QR code at 1:08:08.,
I really hope there's a moment where the cats having a hairball and B12 gets all worried thinking the cats dying,
"Jack: Cutest game ever made
SuperHorrorBro: Makes a video

My brain: Something;s wrong, I can feel it.",
"I love the variety of different cat sounds, my favorite are the mufs murfs/mufings as I call them. Reminds me of my cat",
"the music in this game rly reminds me of Jak & Daxter, which is totally fitting for the vibe- love it",
When they get separated😭😭,
"Dystopian is the word you are looking for. ie; post-apocalyptic. Did the ""soft ones"" die or did they leave and abandon their outdated technology?",
43:29 I respect he sought a peaceful option first instead of just attacking the cat,
"i remember seeing this game in like mid 2021 a year ago, now it’s out and i don’t have a good enough computer to run it.",
"Jack is amazing, but I find it funny he was so busy talking about the cat he didn’t say anything about the strange camera watching him.",
Yessssss I’ve been so hyped for this game ngl,
Give Poncho to Eliot! Im sure you already know at this point thooo. You get to fix your tracker,
sean montpelier is in vermont 😭,
CAT GAME,
"24:18 lost opportunity to make a ""purrfect"" joke",
jack needs to record games like these in 4k!,
BACKPACK FOR HIS APPLESAUCE BACKPACK WHERE HE KEEPS HIS APPLESAUCE,
Day 2 of asking for the next part of until dawn,
I know of a creature as cute or maybe even cuter then cats. ₴ⱠɄ₲₵₳₮s. And you play as them in rain world.,
Where’s until dawn????,
We need part 2!,
You know. I didn't do the math when I played.... The robots have had souls for over six million years?,
As soon as I saw the cat fall I knew I couldn’t watch this anymore. The injured lonely cat brings too many emotions to a cat owner 😭,
"Only 11 minutes in and already refusing to watch any further into the video after what just happened!

all jokes aside, very good game and a good video, a great combo once again",
I want a dog version as well. I will riot if this cat dies,
"Jack: “he’s so cute”
My advert: “DATA WITH VODAFONE!!!”",
the pin/button is on the left side of your cats backpack. you collect more over the game and they are placed on your backpack.,
"i love how interested jack is when he plays a solo game, me on the other hand i’ll be 30 minutes in saying “ alright im bored now🙃.”🤣",
The cat just hanging on the edge before it falls while the other cats just stare over at it reminds me of Mufasa's death scene and my heart broke all over again 😭,
"From now on the Zurks will be known as “little head crabs” 
10:15",
28:20 thats what she said,
"46:23 ""Natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet"" 

Jack: ""Hmm? Did that land on a asteroid and create this virus? 🤔""

No Jack...we call it the Sun.",
"Jack: I'm a cat not a natural disaster.

Me: There's a difference?",
"My cat, Newt, would NOT be as adventurous as this kitty! But he's a good boy anyway.",
they turned that love death and robots episode into a game whaddya know,
This game looks interesting. I have 2 cats.,
"Jack: I'm already in love an attached to this cat.
Me:🥰😍😊🤗 I agree, all 4 cats are so previously adorable. We don't deserve them or any creatures.
Something happens to the 🐈 cat
Jack: my heart is broken 💔😢
Me: Jack save them! 😭😭😭😭😭😱😭😭😭😭 the poor kitty is hurt 😢",
I specifically couldn't play this because I was too upset about the cat potentially getting hurt lol but I'll watch jack play it! The last guardian killed me when treeko got hurt,
This needs to be a movie XDD,
what happened to the until dawn game play???,
The robots speak animalies,
Robot cats vs cats,
"Man, I finished this whole game this morning and wondered, ""I wonder if Jack will make a playthrough"". I'm so glad he is because this game is freaking amazing! :D",
"You already gave note #5 to the guitarist, so just 4 in the store.",
I’m playing this on ps4 and I’m devastated in how bad my graphics are compared to this,
My cat came over and watched me play when I was playing this game.,
my cat is orange with big eyes and little ears this HIT,
I beat it as soon as it came out,
You should try Sky Children its made by the same people who made journey!,
MY COMFORT YOUTUBER PLAYING A GAME I WAS EXCITED FOR??,
Sean is so bad at video games,
"I'm so glad Jack is playing this game! After playing it through I was stunned how deep and interesting it was. I assumed it would be a lighthearted cat game. 
Just a couple of things--sorry if you think this is backseating but Jack seemed somewhat distressed--you will have a chance to deal with the scarf and other activities in the slums. You'll most likely know when you're leaving for good. If you keep interacting with NPCs, they will tell you when you're doing so. 

Also: if/when you take another bucket ride, try looking in different directions and spinning in circles. It's a funny little tidbit. 
Thanks for the lovable gameplay and commentary Jack!",
Your impressions are on point 👌,
Jack you should play with your cat for part2 or 3 that would make it even more enjoyable,
"Jack should come back to Astroneer at least for an episode if not more, the game has come a long way since his 2 videos of it back a couple updates, maybe it's something to think about, they have trains and more that have been added, not trying to ruin this video by suggesting something else, this is awesome but astroneer coming back would be cool too",
I dub this cat's name Tangy,
Could you give the poncho to that electronics robot? I wonder.,
"23:40 the difference is Nate should know better, the cat don't",
Jack not finding the library safe right away is EATING AT MY SOUL,
"I was really hoping you were going to play this, just to play a little guy of a kitty",
9:05 I...need to hug my cat,
"jack: keeps running past the last battery
me: ITS RIGHT... RIGHT THE-... *JACK*",
what an aMEOWzing game !,
Me and my cat loved this my cat was like genuinely invested in it the whole video and my cat has like no attention span lol. Anyways she loves the game so far she really likes the cat aspect of it lol,
Jack love his buckets,
"The poncho is used after you attach the receiver on the top of the tower, so don't worry you'll get rid of it.",
"The meow mechanic mkes me get goat sim vibes.......from the tutorial


Edit: this was one  l   o   n   g  episode",
Cat,
"*im calling it right now, that “AI” is actually the scientist and the transfer to the online world warped their memory.*",
Can I just say one thing the” Half life monsters” Sound like guinea pigs,
Schrodinger's cat,
"This games lighting reminds me Kakurenbo: Hide & Seek, I love it so much. Such a beautiful movie and such a beautiful game.",
I WAS WAITIGNG FOR THIS FUCK UES,
Anyone else getting Love Death Robot vibes?,
Jack you should play life is strange true colors,
The cat looks and acts a lot like my little kitty honey she is a sweetie but also quite adventurous and playful I can't wait to see the rest of this journey,
"Anyone one else think the intro is just rain world 3d?

Cat like creatures traveling in a group, crossing a chasm, one falls in and you control the one that fell",
"love this game the second i saw the trailer, please make more episodes lol.",
Omg I cant wait to play this game it looks amazing,
My nefuew has a cat caled Momo,
WAITED SO LONG FOR THIS GAME!!!!! ITS BEEN 84 YEARS….,
Hey jack there a new god of war 5 coming out its for pre order now are you going to play it I loved the last god of war gameplay,
"You have to ""meow"" at the robots, each one of them have different interactions when you meow at them, not really related to the objectives but it's cute.",
the way you said basketball,
I was yesterday Sykkuno playing this game it's so adorable,
Brazyray on twitch yall,
Jack. Are you alright? You just seem off— I hope you are alright. If you need another break you can take one— or even quit YouTube all together it’s fine. We love you. We just want you to be healthy— mentally and physically.,
Look how happy Sean is ☺  amazing game!,
"Sean: I don't see another battery
Also Sean: *passes right in front of the fourth battery 5 million times*",
"I'm so GLaD you played this, I've been excited about this game since it was revealed in 2020, I had no idea what the game was gonna be like, I just knew it looked super cute n I HAD to see more! ^_6",
i saw this games tailor and i just knew you would play this game and im so happy you are!,
Oh the struggle... Do I want Jack to focus on his replay of Until Dawn? Or Stray? >~<,
"I personally think, that due to the name of the game, the cats are strays. And humanity’s NOT dead",
i just finished playing this i named the cat sink i highly reccomend u play more,
"The last guardian is my all time favorite game, even named My Irish  wolfhound trico! But I have afeeling this games gonna destroy me",
"this entire video is, jack sees cat... hijinks ensue.",
"The ""heeheeeee""s he keeps doing is the universal cat lover language for being impressed when they do anything",
"What I find interesting in the area where you get the backpack is the robot attached to the pod, with a note “I hope this will work”. It would seem a human tried to transfer their conciseness into a robot (maybe for a couple reasons)",
The new spider man game is out! cant wait for the series,
I’m calling it now there’s gonna be a section in the game where you’re injured and you’re limping and the game is going to be tugging on your heartstrings,
"First game that made me cry
(the part where the cat fell from the pipe)",
it only took me 8 hours to finish the game but the quality alone is worth the money,
CUTE!!!!,
"I don't know why, but B-12 sounds exactly like Professor E. Gadd from Luigi's Mansion, and I'm loving it! 😁",
Why are robots  wearing clothes?,
"Isn't the other music sheet with the musican? The one who played the guitar and the cat sang along?
Haha, I hadn't watched the end yet 😅",
More I need more,
You plan on playing the last of us remake on ps5 when it comes out (in september i think),
Not me having warrior cat flashbacks,
JACK! GIVE THE PONCHO TO THE ROBOT YOU SLEPT WITH ON THE ROOF YOU PAST MULTIPLE TIMES! Geez...,
"Love the intro. Nice to get right in, and quite unique for this genre of video.",
"Never really been a cat person, I'm much more of a dog person but this game is still really intriguing and cute, I'm looking forward to more of it. Especially the world of the game and the cat definitely gives a very unique perspective. 
Also B-12 and even the Zurks are cute, everything in this game is just cute.",
"When I heard you talking about Momo I nearly died. That's my name, and I did a double take and was like ""wait, whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat?""",
The ginger and black cats look **so** much like my first two cats...!,
I just wish I had a good PC to run this game.,
"i really wanna see jack play concrete genie, i personally think it's a good game",
"I love how far this channel has come, I remember the Happy wheels, I miss you playing that, can you please return to happy wheels one last time because SPEED IS KEYYY",
15:00 Jack commits paint slaughter,
I saw this game on steam just before seeing this- I have to buy this game now.,
"wait almost 2 hours of one video and its part 1 only, holy",
"I know you might not see this Séan, but the cats name is Murtaugh, which is based on an IRL stray found by the 2 devs!",
"This is giving me strong NieR:Automata vibes, I adore that game. Loving this so far, can’t wait to see the rest of your play through! So cute 🥰",
"1:08:32 there was something very ""LeviOsa, not levioSA."" about how he said that.",
"Cat of Persia, the Meow Within",
Seeing this vid pop up in my feed just gave me so much happiness without even watching the vid yet,
Every time that cat nearly slipped my anxiety was just 📈,
What if the infection started here and the city was built around it,
I'm so sorry you hurt your back!  Hugs!  Cute game though....I'm gonna buy it on Steam!  Mama JO,
one thing that bugs me about the beginning is that cats don't actually meow at each other. pedantic I know.,
"I bought the game yesterday and beat it today, I wish it was longer but it was amazing either way",
"Sean should really do a playthrough of RDR2 imo. I mean, there's literally an Irish that you meet pretty early in the game AND his name is Sean!",
"Jack:   ""I am a cat not a natural disaster""

Me:   ""I don't think Jack has meet more then one cat to truly understand what he just said, lol"" XD",
Still $30 for a 3 hour game about a cat. Jeez idk man,
"I'm already in love with this game. It's so interesting to see the world- like how the B-12 had pictures of living things and trees in their bedroom before the cat got there, or how they knew to lead the cat to them for help. It's like the opposite apocalypse is happening after the apocalypse has already happened- machines already took over, humans are dead, and now the robots are afraid of ORGANIC matter since it's eating everything. The cat and its mechanics are amazing enough as a game, but they made it even better by adding sci fi and cyber punk themes- I'm so stoked for more 😄",
Omggg when you said uncharted i said uncarted and you said it as well at the same time as me! Thats so cool!!,
He slid a b99 reference lol,
It is so awesome to watch and hear Jack's reactions to this game. I can't wait to finish my playthrough as well. What a cute game. ^0^,
this game makes me happy and kick my legs like a school girl,
"As someone who's lost their cat very recently, just seeing the cats play together in the beggining made me instantly sob.
Also the biiig stretch, that's always something I used to say to her in a baby voice. The tears haven't stopped 20 minutes in, and I just might buy this game as s form of therapy 😅",
"b12 is a vitamin that helps improve your mood, adorable detail",
"I am convinced that every time a cat stretches, everyone one around is required to say ""ooo, big stretch"". I have cats and I automatically say it when I see them stretching.",
Seeing how each robot reacts to the Cats meow is the best serotonin boost I needed today.,
OMG JACK THANK YOU,
YES!!! I've been waiting for this game to come out forever! Seeing Sean play it makes my entire week.,
"Vitamin B 12 helps against fatigue and muscle failure. So pretty much, it’s what’s keeping our muscles nice and strong, and it’s also keeping us from feeling weak and tired. Fun fact! :)",
the city reminds me of the fortuna colony in warframe😭😭❤️ i love this,
The cats drinking water from the puddle is the cutest thing I’ve ever seen.,
My cats kept jumping at the screen and then following the cat around  through each level!,
i finished this game this morning and i cant wait to see how he will go through the game differently!! what an amazing game,
"Jack “Natural light that leaked from a star, did that have something to do with the infection” 

There talking about the sun",
I lowkey stopped playing after the cat fell at the start 😂 to sad,
Waaallllleee lol,
I thought this was DanTDM's video because the thumbnail and title are so similar X D,
"Fun game, but hard to get into the video with an ad break every 2-3 minutes",
I'm already melting from how adorable the first interaction is and I want this game,
Unless they all have Canon names im giving them Warriors ones,
Yeah that's what we're talking about baby Woo,
but cmon Up is one of the best movies ever.,
ive also been doing horrible like my whole summer break and this is really nice to watch rn its calming me down and giving me something else to think about thank you :],
Not me watching this with 2 of my 3 cats sitting on my bed with me,
I like how the game gave you a light instead of using the cat's natural ability to see in the darkness,
Catttttssssssssssssssss,
24:10 I loved when Jack said [the perfect  game] (me not trying to laugh at perfect game),
So CUTE!,
"If there's no humans, who are they gonna eat?",
"This game really reminds me of games like OneShot and Hyper Light Drifter, especially in the setting",
Why did jack copy half of DanTDM’s thumbnail and title,
As soon as jack posted this video stray became top search on ps store,
Why dont you get a Cosmo for BB,
We must protect this cat AT ALL COSTS,
"yoooooooo... ""human music.. hmmm.. i like it"".... rick and morty reference... nicely done!!..",
The postcard and the mural kind of reminds me of the Shell Beach postcard and subsequent mural in the movie Dark City.,
god this game is adorable but i for some reason get a lot of motion sickness from it. even tried turning off motion blur but it didnt help :/,
"4:50
5:18
7:10
18:56
19:24",
add mating and this game is beyond perfect,
"46:33, sounds like ""no, we don't like money.""",
"Jack you gotta play Blink, it’s a horror game that I think you would like. It revolves around, what the title says, blinking.",
"Today: Cats ride roombas.
The Future:",
Where’s until dawn 😩,
are you gonna play the new slimerancher when it comes out?,
"46:21

They are talking about Sunlight, not infection

Most havent been to ""The Outside"" so not all have witnessed the Sun. Therefore, the idea of sunlight is passed down like a folktale",
"The whole time I'm watching this, every time Jack points out ""Except I don't care because I'm a cat"" and stuff, I'd think of that meme of the cat sitting on a rock by the ocean. 
'Frank looked out over the majestic rocky coast bathed in the grandeur of the setting sun.... and he thought of nothing, because he is a cat.'",
"FUCK, I HAVE TO WAIT FOR THE NEXT VID, WHY COULDN'T I HAVE JUST BEEN LATE?",
This gives Rainworld vibes and i am here for it,
Ahh digital quantum storage at its finest,
Jack love this game do more,
"46:28 

That relates to what I believe is the sun going out",
This video is just jack loving cats and graphics.,
I think that the scratching mechanic is to keep track of where you've been. That's my guess at least.,
B-12 helps agenst loneness. seriousness it helps with memory loss,
We don’t want part 2 we need part 2,
"0:00- ""We all know why we are here."" To watch a video and leave a 'long comment' for good ol' Jack who always keeps me company after work? You beat me to it again. I have a copy of this game and want to play it, but then video(s). No matter, I can play this later on.
0:43- ""As a cat owner myself now, I am incredibly attached to this game."" I had a feeling that Gab would play this. Wasn't sure if you would or not. Does BB like watching either of you play Stray? I have read that some people's cats are quite curious about this game.
1:21- You smooshing all over the cats realistic behavior is so cute. :)
2:52- Barely 3ish minutes in and I am very impressed with the visuals and music/sound. Can't wait to see what they did with the story and gameplay mechanics.
6:32- ""When all of humanity dies, cats will outlive us all."" I always thought that it would be cockroaches. Those nasty bugs are basically indestructible.
9:37- ""Oh my God, my heart is breaking in half."" :( Little Red needs you to help them find their family- keep going.
14:12- ""I got a bucket, Baby!"" (narrator voice) Little Red now has a bucket. It is shiny and just the proper size. Little Red will now never be lonely again, and may find some new DLC.
16:33- ""Do you think if I left the cat long enough he would just sit down?"" Probably, or take a nap.
19:14- ""Don't they kind of look like headcrabs?"" Yeah, and it is gross! They also look like tardigrades to me.
24:17- ""The past couple of days, even the past week, I have been feeling a little miserable."" :( I hope that it goes better for you soon. Count all of the little things before bed- it helps. (tasty hot food, a call from your bestie, nice bath, ect.)
30:08- ""Wait, I don't actually see another one."" The PC in the middle of the room has one on its tower.
47:01- ""Hear that Everybody? We are the Soft Ones."" Compared to them, we are. These beings seem like leftover human consciousness put into robot form. They don't seem like usual robots to me. Maybe humans were dying and made these beings to live on in a new form?
54:48- ""I am so turned around, I don't know where I have been, it is kind of confusing."" You will get it eventually. Shame that this game doesn't have a mini-map or something.
1:01:02- ""But as a Gamer, I never will. I am stuck inside."" That's no good! Even a walk around the block helps now and then. Maybe when it isn't 40C out, right?
1:08:24- ""What does B-12 help against?"" Vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) plays an essential role in red blood cell formation, cell metabolism, nerve function, and the production of DNA.
1:15:50- ""It was only 1 that I needed, right?"" At the moment.
End- This was wonderful. I'd love to see more soon! ~",
"Completed it. 6 hours and 100%, what a beautiful game. You're gonna love if Jack",
Game is like 5hrs longs played through fully. It's a great game 6.5 million years since a.i took over,
I swear I saw the exact scene at 11.37 days before this was released,
Day 255 - The fact that Seán hasn't played Titanfall 2 is crazy to me. I would love to see a playthrough of it. I think he'd love it!,
seeing the cat flop over right as the backpack was put onto it is hilarious.,
The B99 reference did not go over my head.,
moor moor mmmmmmmmmoooooooooorrrrrrrrrrr need moooooor cute and fuzzy cat pls do the full story,
"My guess is that b-12 isn't an AI, but an uploaded human mind. That's why all of their memories are very human, and they convenient can't remember their name",
Hello fellow soft ones,
"1:22:30 that’s 6,972,261 years, 9 months, and around 17 days.",
"Past Sean: “ I don’t want to find all the collectibles

Proceeds to collect as many collectibles as possible",
"omg i completely forgot about the last guardian, i loved that game so much :(🫶",
I was hoping Jack would play this game! I’m glad he did I can’t wait to binge them! 💜,
"First 2 minutes: I love how we can play with our buds!
Next few minutes: Okay, dread and anxiety are forming as we walk with our friends.
9 minutes in: Pauses to go check on Real life cat because anxiety is now so high.",
"""I'm a cat, not a natural disaster."" They have obviously met my torti Penelope the Pernicious, Destroyer of Knicknacks.",
"Jack: ""It's a cat not a natural disaster""
Me: What's the difference?",
Why does that little robot talks like the doctor in Luigi's Mansion? 😂,
I want that on the nintendo,
I dm'd jack on insta and said you should play it and I'm so happy he is. (I know he would've played it anyway but still).,
are you no longer playing until dawn?,
"When he finally realized that he already gave a music what to the musician I screamed so loudly inside,  the entire time I was shouting that he already found the fifth one",
"Just finished playing the game. No spoilers obviously, but god did I love it. The cat is sooooo cute",
I remember watching the trailer for this game and hoping beyond hope that you'd do a let's play of it. I'm very excited to watch more!,
Trico will always be the number 1 Big fluff,
Such a cute game,
The sun. It’s the sun Jack,
"best intro, stright into the game love it.",
Poncho goes to Elliot,
The closest thing will ever get to  a warriorcat game!!! 😳👀,
"Huh a game where someone from the outside comes and goes underneath a “mountain like” dome where have I seen something like that 

Cough cough undertale cough cough",
"jack, you the music badge is on ur little backpack! also, you get to go back to the slums again later",
Just goes to show that everybody truly does want to be a cat,
"I also didn't find who the poncho belonged to, so after progressing I still have it. Big sad.",
I got to a1:18 before I started having cuteness overload. I'm going to have to watch this in chunks.,
"Worlds like this I like to call “make-shift living”. Everything they live in and know is made from scraps and what little they have. It can be small, homey, made from rusted metal and duct tape but it’s so aesthetically pleasing and I love it",
"Small cat facts(from memory you can always look em up 💛) 
Most all orange cats are male 
Most or all calico are female
When a cat slowly blinks at you it's like a lil kiss/ they trust you
Grapes are toxic to cats
Cats shed their claws and whiskers",
Don't cats in video games want to make you visit your own cats?!,
The graphics are just so pretty😻.,
Meanwhile I'm sitting patiently for more Until Dawn... though tbh I've been wanting to see this for a while.,
This is so random and idk why but I had a dream last night where we facetimed. I was very anxious but happy. You were your normal self while I tried not to fan girl. We just had a normal conversation 🤣. Seemingly no reason to why we ended up talking either.,
Love this game 😍,
Jack why are you wearing a hat,
Jack’s unfettered joy in this game and it’s intrinsic cuteness...worth every moment!,
"If anything happens to the cat, everyone will freak out.",
aw that settles it im getting this game asap,
"if the physical items were digitized into the backpack, was all of humanity digitized onto the internet?",
I watched DanTDM play this while I was laying in bed last night and the very first I noticed was how good the lighting is,
"me, 10 seconds into game: this is the best game 10/10 perfect game nothing else compares",
Im in the hospital right now and im trying not to scream to loud when that cat fell. I think i might raise suspicions.,
"My cat brought inside the house a live bunny
I'm sure he could survive like this

he's name is Bertie btw",
"Jack: oh well, the outside is probably destroyed! Oop
Also Jack: was outside at the beginning of the video",
GOTY,
Just watched Evelyn play this yesterday 🥰,
"I saw Gab’s vid on this game in my feed, so I kinda expected to see Sean play it too, but this is still so serotonin inducing.",
"Hey Sean, I haven't been feeling well this week either and this video really helped so thanks a lot, hope you feel better :D",
"@5:14 Jack, that's what a HOUSE cat would do, not a cat that's accustomed to living in the wild for most of it's life.",
they look like ticks.,
Stray Kids,
meow at the camera,
I like the reference to C14 (Minecraft music composer)!,
"*""Hehehe, So Cute.""*

Agreed, this game has a lot of atmosphere, and cats are awesome. Loving this game wo far! 😊",
So cute...and the game looks designed so beautiful and animated so well. Controls seem good too? I'm pausing the video to go play this myself first!,
"Sean: ""Hey, what's up!""
Cat: *meows*
Sean: *satisfied giggling*",
Why did Jack have to me a video about cats after my cat had gotten so sick that the emergency for pets told me that they couldn’t do anything because my cat far more dead then alive and was in so much pain that my father decided to allow them to put her to sleep.,
"when Jack put a paper bag on cats head, such a genuine laugh hahaa",
Wild cats with no humans around don't meow I thought.,
jack the mother boards around the town are maps i think with sorti being the elivator,
aw the 2 first cats(ginger and black) ones remind me of the cats my housemates have they are brothers and also have this behvaior :3,
"hey Seán, i don't know if you'll see this but I wanted to let you know that watching your videos is getting me through a bad period of burnout and being really unmotivated as an artist trying to get through my a-level course. i've been watching your content for years and discovering games you've played like subnautica and sally face and bendy has influenced my art and I wouldn't have found them without you. now I come back to your channel because it's a familiar place to get inspiration and comfort when things aren't going right, so thank you for being there for us.",
"I'm an absolute *sucker* for post apocalyptic landscapes - I love how plants take over everything, it looks so beautiful
This game is absolutely stunning :'0 I haven't been so in love with a games visuals since the first time I saw the Last of Us",
OMG– Yes- this is AMAZING- soooo cute- X3,
"today my older neighbor across from me almost had heat stroke, again.  she ended out getting stuck in tulsa when her suv stopped working, which it was around 110F degrees (about 43C) but realfeel made it feel 10 degrees hotter than that due to the humidity and by the time she finally made it home, she was on the verge of heat stroke.  i got her a cold bottle of water and walked her dog for her while she sipped the water.  she has been having issues with the ac unit, so we turned on her little portable fan to help cool her off since she wasn't strong enough to go get into a cold bath.  i sat with her for a little bit to make sure she was okay.  she told me she had heat stroke 3 times before this, so she knew the symptoms and how to deal with it.  and even though i was nervous about leaving her alone, she told me that she would be okay and to come back in three hours.  and said that if she didn't answer my knock or ringing the doorbell, to go to her bedroom window and knock and then if she still didn't answer, to go get the maintenance lady to open her door for me because we wanted to make sure she was okay first instead of calling for an ambulance for a false alarm, you know?  she has no issue with having to go to the hospital, but it comes down to cost and stuff because she would still be charged for the ambulance coming out and it being a false alarm.  i checked on her three hours later and to also walk her dog again.  she was still rather nauseous, but better, and i had given her small bottles of apple and grape juice that i had, since i read that fruit juice also helped those with heat exhaustion/stroke and she felt like she wouldn't be able to eat anything without getting sick.  and then checked on her a couple hours after that and again to walk her dog for the last time tonight and she said she was feeling a lot better.  she plans on heading right to bed and said if she needs me that she'll call or text my phone.

ever since her accident a couple months ago where she was literally hit by a car, i've been checking up on her more often than before.  the doctors told her that they were surprised she was even alive with how bad it was.  i'm the only one that cares enough to check on her and she also has three grandkids she raises. everyone else either lives too far, or literally could care less about her, including her own daughter.  the grandkids are currently visiting other family, so she is alone at the moment and that worries me more.  she's able to get around better than when she first came back from the hospital, but she is still recovering from broken hip and broken shoulder.  even my 14 yr old son has been helping me take care of her and helping walk the dog for her.  i kept telling her that she doesn't need to be out in this heat, especially with no ac in her car/suv, but she's stubborn and hates asking for help, which i understand, i'm the same way, but still.  i wish i had a license, and/or a car so that i could take her where she needs to go, or at least give her something with ac, but if i were to get a car, i'd be stuck living in it because it'd cost more than my rent at the moment.",
I love how jack looks at the battery and does not notice its there lmfao,
"I fricken lost it when the robot put the jacket on the cat. 🤣🤣🤣🤣 Poor baby like, ""what is this foreign thing GET IT OFF""",
2:36 ayy Brooklyn nine nine!!,
Hey why is the calendar on my birthday,
"When it talked about a star that gave light and warmth, instead of Jack making the conclusion that it was in fact the Sun, he went to infection. XD",
OMG YOU PLAYED IT THANK YOU,
"I love Jack going ""Oh did the infection land from an astroid or something?"" When its talking about the sun <3 this is why I watch this, always get a chuckle",
"As a cat, shouldn't you be able to see in dark 😭 anyways this game is cute af I love it!!",
The cat is named Winston I believe,
The cat will die,
1:10:28 i loved that episode of rick and morty,
"""Natural light that came from a star and landed on our feet; it brought warmth"" isn't that just the sunlight?",
Where did until dawn go or have you given up on it????,
"Ok, I just had a weird moment. Had my mouse sitting flat on my table, but the cursor on screen kept moving, I thought it was part of the video but Jack's hands were in view of the camera. I was so confused lol. Turned out my dogs running around barking at the guy working on a car in our driveway was making my mouse move just enough to be noticeable. Lmao. I was like ""What the hell?! Is that part of the video or am I losing my mind?"" Hahaha *forehead slap* Should have had a V8 today..",
i was watching this on speaker and at 4:30 my cat looked like she was going crazy trying to find where the sounds came from 😭,
"YEEEEES!!! I was hoping you'd play this, I got it as soon as it released!! Best game so far!",
My cat is snuggling in my lap and perked up when  the cats meowed and was glued from then on,
So I'm guessing Until Dawn is scrapped. :(,
Your video is helping me since my parents just got divorced thx jack 😊,
Just watched Hollow play this and it was pretty dope 🤘🏽,
The beginning litterally almost made me cry. Pls dont hurt the kitty lol,
Yes I’m so excited to see you play this!!!!,
"A great example of the fact that visual storytelling is just as, if not MORE important than explicit storytelling to build the world and immerse you.",
B12 as a vitamin is a metabolism booster and it helps with mood and anxiety. (They put it in energy drinks to give you more energy and also to combat the anxiety people get when they consume to much caffeine),
Dystopian would be the word for the type of world we're looking at. Post apocalyptic would also be good as well! I love this game so much it's grabbed my cats attention!,
"this game is really living up to my expectations, im having so much fun playing it :,)",
16:17 I love he mentioned his bb's scratching post bc I saw his TikTok about buying the wrong one,
"Previously on Sean loving graphics: “Joel, NO! But look at that lighting!”",
the robot that was on the second story of the programmer(?) was shaking.  It is probably the robot that needs the panucho,
"idk why but this game fives me vibes from ""the last station""",
"I have never been more frustrated than when Jack asked if you can chatter with the cameras and I was internally like ""yes! You can!"" And then he proceeded to pan the view downwards so the camera was out of frame as he meowed and he missed the nodding.",
11:44,
Only 30 minutes in and I’ve already had three mini heart attacks over this cat jumping very precariously on stuff,
"i was literally bawling my eyes out when i got to the part where the cat fell
i felt bad that he fell, but what really got me was the other cats meowing in the distance for their friend
don't hmu only real ones know",
Anyone else think it looks like the flood from Halo 😬😬,
I think he missed a music note at 1:20:55 on a plate,
"Jack you are such a treasure man. I've been watching you since 2010 and I enjoy your content so much and you inspire me so much. I remember one time on my birthday I got a hat you used to wear, kinda like a newsboy cap because I begged my parents to get me one and I wore it almost everyday. My favorite series I watched on this channel was probably either Detroit Become Human or Fran bow. I really enjoyed those. Keep up the amazing work jack!",
i never want this series to end,
"As soon as it came out I got it and played it in one day, now my new favourite game [took about 8 hours]
Then I find out Séan made a video playing it, love it! [Also don't worry, you need the poncho a little bit later in the game]",
"When they said finding a blue sky was a beautiful dream I laughed, my first two attempts playing this game I got trapped in the sky by a glitch before I could even fall into the city.",
I was so excited for you to play this game!! :D,
just played this entire game last night and i cried a few times. its one of my favorite games now.,
finally a good game,
OH THE LITTLE MUSIC PIN ON THE VEST IS SO CUTE,
Cat 🐱🐈🐾,
"When I saw the thumbnail, and saw that THE jacksepticeye is playing stray, I was super happy and exited to watch it",
Five minutes in and it's already killing me with cuteness,
"i got the game, played for about 50 mins, then refunded it. its not a bad game, just not something i find fun to play. am i gonna watch jack play the whole game? yes, yes i am.",
"“It’s not the last of us, it’s the cats of us” that made me giggle, watching jack play last of us I and II was amazing",
You know it’s a good game when a youtuber puts part 1 for a 1.5 hour video,
"The cat: *almost falls on multiple occasions*



Jack: *HEART ATTACK MODE ON*",
my sister and i just played through this game yesterday! single-handedly one of the most delightful indie games out there— hats off to the developers of this amazing adventure! ❤️,
Until Dawn?,
"omg first time watching after years, i remember the happy wheel days",
i dislike this game. its stupid. the last guardian did it so much better,
"After re-watching the last of us on jacks channel and seeing this, I feel so much better. Jack is also wearing the same hat in the last of us two ep 13 :)

Edit: I forgot to say this but it tripped me out after hearing saying ""instead of the last of us it's the cats of us""",
The last of us but cats,
"I am SO happy you’re playing this, I didn’t think you would!! I finished the game yesterday and I ADORED it",
Please finish the replay of Until Dawn!,
"on one hand, I want to keep watching this... but on the other, I also want to go into this semi blind...
damn it, I'll make do with the first 30 minutes and decide on that!",
I love watching both jack and Evelyn's videos when they're playing the same game. It's so fun to see the differences in how they approach it,
"just finished this game and it is pawsome
achievement hints: meow 100 times, die 9 times, jump 500 times, finish game in 2 hours",
My cat had the same reaction when we put a harness on him. Walked like it was so heavy he couldn't walk and just kept laying down. Only stopped faking it when he learned it meant he could go outside on walks with it.,
I feel like the music kicks in and only turns off whenever you find everything in the little areas. The only reason I really think that though is because every time he would find something in a area the music would cut off,
"Jack: “I’m gonna talk about the lighting! >:D”
Me who knows nothing about it but enjoys Jack talking about it: “Please continue! :0”",
The animation is actually fucking insane,
"This game is getting so much more publicity than I figured it would. Thanks to you, I really hope that they add more to the game like DLCs or other things. Multiplayer through the story would be awesome",
"1:22:33
I translated the days to years and google says it's 6698289 years. Long time...",
"This video brought me lots of joy jack keep it up, love to see you laugh and giggle at games <3",
i literally said “oooooh big stretch” in time with jack lmao,
I wonder what a cat hater will say if they play this,
"I'd like to nominate this game for best game ever, completely overlooking any faults or problems there may be with it because GATO",
"You aren’t missing one music sheet, you gave it to the musician already. So u needed 7.",
"Trust me, I have owned cats my whole life, all it takes is one cat before you fall in love with them and realize how much they are misunderstood.",
I had this game on my wishlist and seeing it released I wanted to watch gameplay so I’m glad jacksepticeye did a gameplay of it it seems adorable 😭🤌,
I want to watch this so bad but I have to play this game FOR MYSELF!!,
I really wish they had made this a dog game. Still buying it though,
* *enters comments to see who else saw the battery on the desk* * ah so I’m the only one yelling at me phone this is nice,
"Jack: Imma play this super cute cat game!
Me: I WANNA PLAY CAT GAME! I GREW UP MIMICKING ANIMALS!
Me a few hours later: ...I have the game...I SEE NO GOD HERE, OTHER THAN ME! I GET TO PLAY IT MYSELF NOW!

But seriously, I wanted to play a game and experience it myself. Now that I'm old enough to get things myself (I was an early teenager when I started watching Jack with no way of purchasing video games, especially online) I'm so happy that I can watch a little bit from Jack and then be like ""Alright! Let's jump in!"" and experience game worlds on my own. I've gotten about twenty minutes farther than what Jack ended here, and I'm so excited to keep going! I can't wait to see Jack's reactions after I've played through myself! And I promise no spoilers! I'm not that kind of person. 

If you see this, thank you so much, Sean. You've raised me into a gamer and now I get to go and do it on my own! To a cat-tastic journey, buddy! ^w^",
What about Until Dawn?,
"as someone who lost their childhood cat a little over a month ago, this game brings me oh so much joy. 
i miss him ._.",
last of us but C A T,
did you just make a brooklyn 99 reference???,
You gave sheet 5 to the robot,
Are- are we not finishing Until Dawn? :(,
"jack, the little robot does make sounds with the cat :]",
Mazer runner lore but with cats ?,
10/10 thumbnail,
"When the cat fell and got injured, it gave me flash backs to when my cat got run over by a car and died in my arms, it still hurts 🤕 my Hart",
When the meowing started all my dogs looked over at my phone… they know something we don’t.,
So B12 is literally just a ghost from destiny.,
I just want until dawn it’s all I crave it’s all I need,
Finally! Cat simulator!,
Was so excited to see Jack doing a playthrough of this! This is the cutest little game. I think I’ve worn out the meow button already 🥹,
I got an add for the game while I watching the video,
they sealed this place because they had the infection,
B-12 is for Energy! That’s a pretty fun connection,
when that cat fell i almost started crying as a cat owner myself i am touched with this game,
"Call your cat MILO, it would seem to fit for me anyway! Also, you and Gab Smolders have very similar reactions to this game so far, I just watched her video this morning!",
"I literally got the ad for this game yesterday, and was like, ""I wonder when Jack's gonna play it"" and here we are lmao",
I love how Jack reads about the sun and thinks it’s some sci fi alien stuff,
"The robots in this game really remind me of calculester Lmaoo, and the fact that jacks playing it just makes it so much more funny to me.",
man this must have been fun to edit,
"The second kitty you played with looks like my Oliver! (Ollie) 😃
The beginning is giving me Destiny 1 vibes.....after your ghost revives you and you go into, also called, ""The Wall""!!!

Light that leaked from a star......it's talking about THE SUN! LOL 

How come the stars are in a circle.....or are you under a huge dome that the walls go up to make?",
Cuteness overload,
Is that on the Xbox one ? If so whats the game called 🤔,
If you like this game I saw another YouTuber play a VR cat game so you may like to play that sometime,
this is like Ecco by Sega but with cats and ten times better,
meow at the cameras it makes them shake their head up and down,
"Since a name hasn't been given, I ended naming my cat Jerry. Did anyone else give a name to their cat?",
"i've been waiting for this game forever, i woke up so excited seeing Sean played this!!!",
I missed let's plays like this from the trico series❤️,
"one of our cats is an orange tabby, and my dad told us about this game right after it came out lol

I just hope my cat doesn't run away too now",
I want someone to animate this journey that the cat goes on,
anytime the cats meowed my cat literally lost her shit,
"Aw great here we go Jack being a cat himself is gonna be too distracted by lights, mirrors, and random objects to bother focusing on all the story and other important stuff happening right in front of him, this is gonna be a whole letsplay of the camera flipping around staring at feckin' walls and floors because ""oooh! Shiny puddle!""",
Omg I was just thinking today that I hope you make a video on this ! Thank you! You have helped me more then you'd ever know. I'm in a terrible spot with my mental health. And watching you has helped me a lot.,
30:10 Walks And Looks Past It Like 4 Times,
This made we want to go love my cats 😅😂,
"I love these types of games, but awe 💕🐱",
did Sean see that the camera shake at you when you meow,
"tbh i didnt know i needed this specifically today, thank you this is awesome!",
"I think we all knew, deep down, from the very first trailer...

_This game was going to be _*_adorable._*",
"Me and my mother bought top of the morning coffee for my brother because he loves coffee and has watched you for i belive over 6 years and in few days he turns 17, And i think my mother bought the PMA hoodie the same on he had but it got small so yhea his birthday is 25 of july so if you see this please wish him happy birth day",
You can really see the love put into this game,
pfft every day in texas its at least 107 its 99 right now but at 4 it should be over 105 90 is cool in texas rn btw,
Yo Sean! What happend to replaying until dawn?,
"Saw this game in an ad yesterday, and i immediatly thought ""lmao i hope jack makes a video on this game."" and oh boy was i hyped when i saw this.",
"My outdoor cat is on strict bed rest after breaking his leg via car, he's a ginger cat too so this got a little surreal when the baba got a sore leg 😅",
I loved watching Sean pass the fourth battery so many times,
"Fun fact: Cats domesticated themselves, unlike dogs which we chose to domesticate. Cats basically did what they always do and decided ""I live here now, you will tolerate or love me"" and we just let them since they were great vermin control. And here my eldest cat 20+ demands I sherpa her everywhere",
Did the sims take over the world or sum?? Sim language???,
When the Cat Fell Down I started Crying,
I have a feeling the scientist is in the lil robot. I wouldn’t be surprised because it’s becoming cliché.,
"A. you can drift the cat if you turn the camera quickly
B. you can make the cat turn in circles in who bucket",
"There used to be 3 games that every gamer should play at least once. 

Fallout: New Vegas
Portal 2
Undertale

Now there's 4 and this game is the 4th.",
"Jack: ""If anything happens to this cat i will kill everyone and then myself""
*something happens to cat*
Evelyn: ""feck""",
"Idk why but this gameplay kinda reminds me of the Daxter PSP game - Great play through, looking forward to more from you and Gab!",
It's like FAR lone sails but with cats and colour,
I had to scroll to the end to make sure the cat was okay before watching,
I want to play,
IT'S like parkour but with cats.,
The fact im watching this with my ginger cat who looks identical!  makes me so happy 😂,
OMG I love this game! Do good looking,
This video was nice to me after my beloved pet a 10 year old cat passed away (He was the strongest even with his age he still put up a fight to protect its territory) also the cat looks similar this cat,
Hope you are okay down there in England Sean!,
This cat is sooo kuchu puchu❤️❤️❤️❤️,
"Fun Fact: When developing this game, they would put motion capture suits on cats, let them do their cat thing, and record their movements to use in the game. 
I thought that was pretty cool that they use that much attention to details😁",
The purrfect game,
I love you so much Sean,
i was screaming the poncho goes to elliot as soon as you got it😂 i noticed he was shaking and naked,
Pink things are zurks since they tried eating cat they probably ate all the soft ones to ;-;,
"this is the first time i have bought a game on launch day, the first time i have bought a singleplayer game instead of pirating, i have been waiting for this game for about 2 years and now that it's released, i absolutely love it, happy it runs so good on my old af laptop",
CAT!,
Guys Daily reminder they're BOTS in  all comment sections so if you see someone saying something crazy like that they kill baby's they're definitely a bot O_O,
The cat’s reaction to the backpack is my favorite thing in the entire world,
if you want good graphics you will want to play star wars jedi fallen order,
"Watching Sean play this after me playing through, I just noticed the wallpaper in a number of rooms in the game is the carpet from The Shining.",
"9:29
the other cats are crying too",
"Not even five minutes in, and I am getting major nostalgia for the Warrior cats book series. I'm so fucking invested in this game right now.",
As soon as I finished watching this I immediately bought it and played it myself. It's so damn good! Got me right in the feels too 😿,
"jack talking about how cats would take over the world 

mobile game battle cats 😀",
You have to do more of the series I love seeing you game especially this game it’s so like relaxing I almost fell asleep like two times watching this is so relaxing,
I literally screamed when I seen this notification 😭 I love seeing Jack's videos!! It's just what I need to get me through all times!,
"Jack:
Being normal👎
Simping over graphics👍",

"I think the poncho is supposed to go to Elliot, it looked like he was shivering when you first met him.",
"i dont know what 40c is in f, but I know that 36c is verry f*cking bad",
yesssss!!!! i was waiting for this play through from you since i saw it on tiktok,
Until dawn?,
Waiting for new Minecraft content day8,
"You haven’t forgot about Dr. Schneeplestein, have you?",
"Istg, I've had awful past weeks and I've been praying that you'll play this game, seeing that you did makes me wanna sob a huge thank you!",
Is it just me or is it nice to see the main character not be human for once?,
I streamed it tofday I was hoping that Jack would play this,
Is Jack still lifting?,
"I love watching this, because I own a cat and love their adorable species.",
22:00 No you're wrong cats have strong survival instinct,
ive been wanting to play that for a while it looks so good,
Ayyy let’s go,
laughing like a witch 34:44,
i thought little miss fortune was the cutest ;(,
Please have a face cam for your cat while we watch the game,
The start of the game reminds me of portal 2,
it reminds me of warrior cats ahhhhh,
I'm getting cat version of Arcane: League of Legends vibes with the underworld and stuff,
"My American side be like ""40?! That is so-- or right Americans are stupid.""",
"When you meow at the cameras , it shakes up and down like “yes”. Thought it was a cute touch",
I was thinking of downloading this when it was added to ps plus Extra but decided to wait to see if someone was gonna play it and here we are.,
Petition for a BB cam sign here,
Anyone else click on this video because of the thumbnail and title? No? Just me? mk. :),
I don't say big stretch,
I think the poncho was supposed to be given to elliot since he was shaking,
I have 2 cats so I need this game,
"1:22:32
That's nearly 6,972,262 years Jack so humans have been dead for a good while. To put that into perspective, modern humans have only been around for 200,000 years ish while the earliest beings we could call humans have only been around for 1.9 million years+ tops. From what we know at least.",
When all humanity dies cats will outlive us all....Jacksepticeye   20/7/2022 haha.,
This game is absolutely adorable.,
Can't believe this game came out on my birthday,
Not me looking through the comments to check if anything bad happens to the cat(s),
Tomorrow i'm getting a cat !,
bro my heart broke down aswell.. i want the cat to meet up with his buddies fr..,
"Make this over again with puppies and it'd be the best game of all time. Seems like a lot of effort for an animal that just kinda.... tolerates us..... 
INB4 ""but my cat loves me just like a puppy"" .... Ok fair sounds like you got lucky... but you could  have gotten a higher chance of being lucky had you gotten a puppy. haha.

Sips *haterade*",
Hey Jack I’ve been watching you for years and you’ve taught me so much got me laughing in the hardest of times and inspired me too start my own channel (I’m still waiting to create a video I like) but basically I would love nothing more then for you to notice me so this is video 8 of commenting until you say hi < 3,
stray: goblin does goblin things in a dead city,
Yay! I have been waiting years for this game and I was hoping you'd play it too! :D,
"ya know, he should really play Cateau. Like Plateau in pronuniation but I think he would like it and I wanna see if he picks the right choices.",
i bet there more unexplored areas in beginning outside the walls...there more coming to this game,
Hey Jack there's like 15 cats at my uncles house who literally right next to us and he hates those cats and he does not care if they die btw would u like being cuddled by 15 cats at the same time and fall asleep on u?,
This game is the definition of living life on the edge.,
Sean's description of when cats jump is so accurate 😄,
"I mean, midgard isn’t entirely wrong. Midgar i think was the name of the city",
"Hey hey septic eye, it is my sworn duty as a “The Last Guardian” Cult member to beg you to replay it! I would cry plz",
FINALLY a good YouTuber that appreciates cats😺,
"please jack try as hard as you can to get all the memories. esp in midtown because there will be 2 more memories after  finishing neco mission and ""going to the club"" . if you immediately went to the club the game will progress by itself and you'll lose these 2 memories",
It’s so hard to play on the keyboard at least to me because I’m not really a keyboard gamer the first scene I had to do at least 5 times,
"Every time the cat jumps, I imagine the Mario jumping sound.",
I love this. So chill. Love the commentary too. More please.,
I can’t play it because my tv broke.,
"if you liked this game you should totally do a gameplay of spirit of the north, it's a game similar to this one except it's with foxes :)",
I love listening to Jack talk nonstop about cats for over an hour lol,
"Really enjoyed this! What a wonderful, imaginative game!",
your cat impression is so good,
it's amazing to see how much jack has grown,
13:16 you can the camera will even shake nvm you found out yourself later in the video my bad,
Can’t wait for this to go on xbox,
"Furbabies, robots, and a apocalypse, lets goooo",
its giving Little Nightmares tho,
it should've been is that THE MOOOOOOOOON?,
plz start saying top of the mornin again it really makes my day,
Hey Sean I know this has nothing to do with the video but I thought you like to know that the slap chop is mentioned in the first deadpool movie,
This is like untitled goose game as a cat in last of us mixed with cyberpunk.,
I knew that you was gonna play this game I've actually been waiting for gameplay,
I loved this game. I already beat it,
Within the first 3 mins we get a b99 reference yay 😁,
9:00 I actually teared up from that part,
"Only thing I didn't like about this game is that one cutscene and moment, at least it was quickly over in a minute or so.",
"After watching not even two minutes of this video, I have to buy this game",
If I fits I sits,
Is it just me or does B-12 sometimes sound like Professor E Gadd from Luigi's Mansion 3?,
Sorry jack but your cat is male and his name is Phoebe? Doesn't make sense but ok I do u,
THAT LITERALLY LOOKS LIKE MY CAT OMG I SQUEALED SO HARD I HAVE A BIG ORANGE CAT THAT PURRS A LOT,
9 minutes in and already needed to hug the cats. 😂👌,
"When I first saw the bucket, I immediately thought of how thrilled you would be to relive the Stanley Parable.",
"Jack said ""I hope so"" to all humans being annihilated yet he's a human too 🤦",
"Im getting this game, but im only watching a portion of this video so i dont spoil it for myself.",
"The more i see all the little details an symbolism the devs added in, the more im conviced whoever made this game is a genius",
"I feel like anyone who has a cat is playing  this game right now, and is noticing similar behaviors with theirs.. loved this game!",
Fastest JSE intro???,
"The city in FF7 is called Midgar, Jack. Very close to Midgard, so I can totally understand the confusion 😂",
Hahaha I love this game I ended up beating it in under a night,
Hey jack what happened to the until dawn revisit.,
"I love that Sean gets so happy whenever the cat does something cute! And every time a cat stretched we said ""Big stretch"" in sync, because that is the only response to a cat stretching",
"congrats on #1 trending in gaming 👏




edit: THE SECOND THE CAT FELL DOWN I STARTED CRYING 


I imagined my cat falling and I couldn't get her and got very VERY sad",
"I was waiting for you to play, I loved Evelyn’s experience it was soooo cute!!🥺",
ok i pull up,
"Jack: If anything happens to this cat I'm gonna kill everyone in this room and then myself
Me, wondering who tf else is in the room: 🤔🤔🤔",
Can we see more until dawn. It’s getting good,
Wish this game was on Xbox then I could play it 😭,
you turned in music 5,
Where boys become men.,
"I just saw this game on steam the other day! I love cats and I’m definitely going to get it when it’s a little cheaper, because it looks fantastic.",
Now we know the ending to the movie 'curve',
"Meteor about to destroy earth
Jack: ""Look at this lighting!""",
"Hey!! Thanks for opening up about how you’re doing, I feel the same way and I’m glad you feel happy playing the game. It makes me feel happy too! Take care",
Yessss me too i lost my phone and this week has gone downhill today headache and my day might as well have been over,
for some reason reminds me of biomutant(worst game i have ever bough),
"6:15
The cat when he gets a grandchild: ""Back in my days the road to college was arduous and difficult. You're only going to step down about 5 meters. GROW UP!""",
"Jack, if you played journey, I suggest playing Sky: Children of The Light. It's made by the same people and is pretty short and easy",
If you love warrior cats it looks like you love this game,
"Jack you should play Citizen Sleeper next, its cool",
Its so funny that he said ooh big stretch. I say that to my dogs all the time. I thought it was less of a thing.,
"2 minutes in and I’m already crying. This game is amazing. I have 4 cats and they’re all assholes. But they are also the cutest ones. This is definitely a game made by people who are just as obsessed with their cats as I am. Also so glad you’re playing it instead. I would never finish the gameplay because I’d just want to be cute cat forever. Lol
Edit: OMG BIG STRETCH. Yes, I said it at the same time. c’:",
honestly i've been playing this game yesterday and it is so therapeutic. cozy asf,
8:40 Rain World moment,
B12 reminds me of how egadd drops in and sounds in luigis mansion,
I love how the bad little dudes look like ticks it's so smart,
"I love how the cat is just a cat. Not any fancy big eye stuff, just a cat. And I love it",
Baseketball. Great movie,
"""we all know why we're here""
jack I've only heard of this game yesterday from a meme that had the playstation font going PSPSPSPSPS",
PART 2 PLSSSS,
"Cat falls, I cry",
This is so cute watching this reminds me of the anime “the cat returns” 💕💕💕 cant wait to get this game 💕💕🥺🥺,
"Humans: I finally learned parkour 😄

Cats: Congratulations, you learned something we mastered at birth🐈",
Fantastic Brooklyn 99 reference around 2 minutes in 😂 I love Rosa Diaz,
I heard about it being 40 in England and smiled a little evilly. I live in Australia and we are no stranger to 40 or above.,
"Stand up close and meow at a security camera, you won't regret it",
YES IVE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS GAME!! AHH 😆,
meme time?,
when are you going to post pt3 of until dawn?,
When is part 2,
"I was so excited for this game that I may have played it all yesterday in 9hours (with short breaks in between)
I loved it.
Excited to see Jacks play

Also had the same basic reaction to the cat falling and being injured. I was like "" IHATE IT. I LOVED IT AND NOW I ALREADY HATE IT"" Poor sweet fur baby. I couldnt.",
Jack not minding people killing eachother in other games but when the cat trips in this game he cares sooo much 😅,
I can't do it the start is to sad,
We need a game theory episode on this game call mat pat,
"I just finished playing for the first time myself, so NOW I can watch this! 🤭💚

Loving the kitty life so far~!",
This is so cute omg,
"I'm just watching a tiny bit to hype myself even more. Ever since it was announced, I've wanted to play it, so I'll just watch a few minutes to preserve the rest of the experience",
This game looks incredibly Ian Hubert inspired which is awesome!,
Is it just me or is the moment where the cat twitched like robot not suspicious,
Its funny how he sat though all the music when there was an option to make the robot stop playing music,
"""I hope they don't drop another paint bucket""- was that because Jack pushed all those paint buckets off of those ledges at the start?",
Sean talking about having a funk week rly got me bc me and my best friend have too and it just seems like weird fate or some crap like that and this video just really cheered me up,
"I dont know if anyone else has said it yet, but you dont need another music sheet. You gave one of them to Morusque already so you already found all 8 :)   EDIT: Jack realized and I made this comment RIGHT before he said it lmao",
cat puns... while playing a cat game. we have hit a new low-,
theres something about a cat being split up from his friends that hits my weak spot,
"Sean: its like the start of up
Me: no, its lion king 😂",
"OMG the battery is right in front of you! Sorry I had to rant, lol",
It’s so sad in the beginning 😭,
why no more top of the morning 🥲,
"I literally played through the whole game in one sitting (missed 5 memories in tense sections sadly) and it took me 8.5 hours and i LOVED it. i was a bit sad at the end, but there was a thing that happened that gave me hope for dlc or a sequel. i really hope so. :D",
Guys saèn is getting old hes talking about the weather,
9:04 watching that made me cry I was concerned for kitty and on edge of my seat. But I'm glad the cat is okay and survived.,
welp i guess jacks dead 2:28 - 8:36,
Rise brothas! The meowll-ing is upon us!,
what an awesome and cute game. i get to experience the world through the eyes of my cat. the animations are so on point too !,
Long.... live .... the king,
This reminds me a lot of the game Spirit of the North. Not many people played it or knew about it but it was basically this but FOXES. And it’s super cute and a great visually stunning game,
I love this so much,
"one of these days, a game is going to have accurately distorted reflections per material and jack is just not going to be able to upload the video without breaking several of the community guidelines.",
Any of y'all remember the book series warriors? Literally the entire plot and story but put into this game controls and graphics would be amazing.,
My flexx is that I've been following thm on TikTok ever since the start lol,
I’m nervous about this game cuz I recently lost my cat in a horrible way and I’m not ready for that kind of emotional trauma again,
46:00 the sun,
This is awesome 😎🔥😍be a cat 🐈 for a day every day,
No. I do not appreciate the cat falling. That hurt everyone on a spiritual level.,
"I just started playing yesterday,and this kitty is both super cute and cool! Please play more of this!",
"See, if this was realistic, the rest of the game the player would be forced to crawl around and fall over every so often because it takes *forever* for cats to get used to wearing something. And their first jump would either be them not even making it off the ground or hitting their head off the platform and falling off again.",
Am I the only one getting adds every 5 minutes?,
I saw a trailer on the game while watching this you have to be 10+,
My prediction for the zurk enemy is that they are some type of super tick that was used by X country to attack Y country,
"I love cat's so much, I looked on my mom's Xbox for this game and it didn't come up but if you're making a series of this gameplay then I'll definitely wacth it",
Petition for jack to play stardew valley,
"jack god im so smart 

earlier jack falls from being dumb 

me its jacks fault",
"""Remember when we had some memories?""
- JSE, 2022",
"When I first saw this on steam, I already knew that jack would play this IMMEDIATELY after it comes out. I love that you played this game as I found it really really creative!",
OH MY GOD THIS GAME IS ALREADY OUT!?!,
"Jack is surprisingly obtuse about story elements sometimes. Like, that little phrase about 'natural light leaking from a star' is literally just about the Sun, not the infection.",
"Gonna say this right now if anything happens to B 12 or ANY cat in this game, the world will not be safe from my wrath",
At 1:03:00 is it me or does the soundtrack sound like it’s from oneshot or something?,
YOOO #1 ON TRENDING,
Cat video when?,
This cat litter of hit something in his brain that made them go full on jimmy neutron mode And make like a suit of armor of cans,
BIG STRETCH!!!!!!!!!,
This is the fckn life. Eating ramen in bed and watching Seán play this game,
"Ah yes, THE catsepticeye",
Omg is the end of this game cats going to Mars lol,
oh?,
"36:50 missed opportunity to say ""Purr Elise""",
Hey jack are u gonna be playing god of war ragnarok when it comes out,
"Jack: Where's the battery? What if there isn't a fourth one,
Me: I know you have ADHD and I have it too. I take medication for it as well but I also saw the battery right there immediately. I know that were all human tho and the cat might be fusing with your brain.",
#1 in trending is video games. Noice 👌,
I’ve been waiting for this game for so long! ❤️❤️,
This game gives me Girls Last Tour vibes.,
i have cats and one of them is crazy and hillarious,
I froze when I saw October 11th my bday,
is anyone else getting like Little Nightmares 2 vibes?? like just a little?,
MORE!,
"1:22:30 according to the math, roughly 700,000 years have passed since the companions gained sentience",
Did anyone else cry when the cat fell at the beginning and hurt himself? No just me,
"This was so cute! Great video septic man, nice to have a new longer story video game going again",
"i wanna watch but i also wanna play for my self, ill be back after i complete the game",
"damn bro, game really released a day after my cats deah. Must be calling to me to play it lmao",
"I played for about an hour today on pc. Besides frame rates dropping I am in love with the game. The art and the detail they put into this game! However, I did cry after the cat fell and I do get slightly anxiety when he almost falls again on some jumps. 

This game messes with your emotions in that first 10 mins. So happy and loving it then instantly they take it away from you. I literally shed a few tears when the cat fell.",
"i just started playing this game as well, im really emjoyinhg it. not what i expected but damn its awesome",
This game hitting jack G-spot,
"I love kitties, I know they are digital in the game but still the cat falling and with know one able to help hurt my heart, very cute game",
you what I miss... I miss the top of the morning intro's they always seemed to make my day better :(,
I usually don't buy games like this but shit I gotta get this one,
Jack and I said big stretch at the same time~,
"I wish I could speak cat. I need to know why despite having food and water in the bowls, a clean litter box and sitting beside me on the bed, my cat still screams at me with a disapproving look on her face every morning. And afternoon. And night.",
"1:36:23 "" I when the wrong way "" showed the Irish within!",
"Be me: Allergic to cats



Also be me: SMASHING MY FACE INTO MY CATS FUFFY FUR",
I love this so goddamn much,
"My sibling was talking about the release of Stray yesterday and I was saying that I didn't think it'd be the kind of game Sean would play, but I am pleasantly surprised to see that he is! The only time I heard about Stray was like a year or more ago when my sibling mentioned it, and over time I just forgot about it. Since I hadn't seen anything about it during development, I didn't know there were robots or anything, so it's all very unexpected for me but also absolutely incredible! I can't wait to see how the story plays out.",
The city reminds me of Ghost in the shell. Defo cyberpunk vibes.,
"Hope you feel better Jack, do things that you like and take rest if you need to :-)",
Uncharted 6: the lost cat legacy,
ugh i started this game yesterday and i criedddddd,
Jackseptickeye. Cat. Scifi. Yes please.,
"I get what you're saying about cats always aiming forever for bigger jumps and how that's not that way in game. But you gotta think how these cats have been living out in the wild like that for who knows how many generations. They don't gotta aim any more. Their instincts are permanently sharp. They don't spend most of their days in a house where everything is super safe and there are maybe a total of two tall jumps. So I think considering that, the quickness of the big jumps in the game is accurate 😁",
Got a ad for this game while I was watching,
"46:22 It's talking about the sun Sean, the sun.",
Sean you got #1 on trending for gaming!!!!!!!,
"Im so sorry! This playthrough just made me realize you are dateing gab! I heard you say about bebe and went ""isnt gabs cat named the samw thing?"" Then had a ""WAIT! GAB TALKS ABOUT SEAN SOMETIMES!"" you two are both my favorites! Both of you keep up the awesome work!",
I can’t wait to see how Jack reacts to and interprets this game and it’s story as he goes along. (Just finished the game myself a few minutes ago.),
when the cat got separated from his catto friends T  ^  T dno if my heart can take this,
I wanna het it but don't really got the momey,
Don't worry Jack. I felt the same way when I started playing. It's such a perfect game.,
"I'm depressed after i saw the cutscene at the start where the cat falls into the city, I cried so hard and this is like the first thing I cried to",
2spooky4me,
Yes. Because a heat-wave in England means global warming is getting us.,
This is purrfect xD lol,
"Don't wanna start any fights or get yelled at for this but when jack asked what language is that, the one all around the city.. if I'm not mistaken in looks like Korean prob. Maybe it a mix of just random things but I do feel like it is Korean.",
46:15 jack thats the SUN,
If I had cats I’d have a ginger cat named Tobey and a gray cat named George,
When jack missed the bucket on the bed 😭,
Sean u gave the guitar person the music sheet number 5,
I am filled with absolute delight that you're playing this,
OH MY GOD IM GLAD YOU DECIDED TO PLAY IT!!!!!!,
"Interesting theory: Humans are all dead.
Does that mean Dogs are the souls sent to give us peace and joy for the time they are allowed to visit us, while cats judge us to let us know our failings?",
anyone else get kirby and the forgotten land vibes,
jack making my cats go haywire,
sean didn't appreciate the music robot >:(,
"This game is like a little fountain of serotonin and honestly, so needed for me too. Its been a rough minute and the amount of little giggles and smiles this game gives me is so refreshing. And its awesome to see you enjoying it in that way too!",
I have an orange cat we named him Sam he's so cute and plays with my other cat nimby he loves to eat food he meows when he's lost or by himself and he likes sucking on thus specific blanket but at least it's not all the blankets,
"When it fell and started limping i paused the vid idk if i can watch it 😭😭 it's crying as well i'm gonna bawl my eyes out 😭 idkkk man i'm so conflicted
Okay i skipped a part and it's not limping anymore i can watch 😂",
Who else is watching this video with their cat? :),
bought this game today and I am enjoying it. really love it.,
Glad to have a YouTuber like jacksepticeye delighted to have a human like Seàn (sorry if I spelled it wrong),
“I hope nothing happens to this cat”,
23:46 almost sounded like andrew tate😂,
"14:11 
Jack: yea I got a bucket baby!
Me: it's the Stanley parable all over again
Jack: *it's the Stanley parable all over again*

Lol wtf",
I’m so happy I have my 15 cats 🥰 noodles says Hi and 6 are watching this with me 🥺,
Cat!,
2:31 BROOKLYN 9-9 REFERENCE WOOOOO,
Blessing upon the crops of everyone ragging on Jack for not knowing the sun when described to him.,
that intro was upsetting 💀 😭,
"Sean: where are we
Game: Inside The Wall
Sean:Maybe like a damn",
How are you,
6:19 I wonder what the interaction was?,
new favorite game <3,
good videooo,
"Thank god I'm not the only one comparing those things to head crabs. As a fellow cat lover, I'm attached to Ginger here ☺️",
I’m so excited for you to keep playing this game 😻,
.,
"Vitamin B12 is needed to form red blood cells and DNA. It's also a key player in the function and development of brain and nerve cells. Vitamin B12 binds to the protein in the foods we eat. In the stomach, hydrochloric acid and enzymes unbind vitamin B12 into its free form.

Also, I was surprised at how pretty and detailed the game is. Maybe it's because some games lately have been less than ideal in terms of graphics. 
I like how the story slowly reveals itself through the environment. It's been a while since I've come across a story that didn't push exposition down ur throat... and cats are so cute.😄",
the badge was on your little jacket btw!! its kinda hard to see bcs its so dark,
"8:52 who else was thinking ""long live the king""
also yes sean it was midgar and yes, if you leave the cat long enough it will sit down, i saw this in another video :D",
"Seàn: time to gush over some graphics

Me: preparing to listen to him talking about reflections for the hour",
1 you never said that. 2 you talk to much and try to be high and mighty your a gamer thats it,
"When he gets to 'the Slums' and the red writing pops up. The large letters look like HOME. And I can't work out the other words except ""one""",
I think Elliot is cold. He seemed to be shivering quite a bit.,
Hey sain you think you can ask ingland to give Texas some of our breeze back it's like 106 degreese right now not a joke,
PITTY CAT!?,
"46:05 That star is called the sun, Sean. :P",
I fucking love this game,
Why is it sooooooooo cute!!!!!!!!,
40*C is slightly above our previous record not well above.,
"34:41
it inhibits my senses ....... see`s the bot  hihihihiiiiiiiiiiii",
"Don't worry, you'll get back to the slums to do the rest of the sidequests soon enough. They'll clearly ask whether you want to progress or not at points of no return",
"game continuously telling Jack to find Momo
jack : does everything but go to Momo",
watching this after Evelyns two parts because i need more cat coooos,
40 DEGREES IS RECORD BREAKING its normal for it to be like 70 to 80,
I love how Jack is constantly pointing plot points out early in the gameplay they explain later on. Man must have premonitions before starting the game.,
"8:39

When this cutscene came up, before I could think I immediately said  ""KITTY NOOO-""",
I had a feeling jack was going to play this game,
"Makes me think of Love, Death & Robots",
Redo last guardian or do sekiro series,
The zurks remind me of malice from Breath Of The Wild,
its a game for furries dont recommend this channel,
"I hope nobody else had made this pun yet, but this game feels like it should be titled: “Cat Life: Alyx”",
Hey Jack I'm wondering if you ever tried VR chat I think they updated it so it might be new for you,
"I've heard about this game here and there, but I'm glad to see someone play it! I love this!",
This is adorable. Love the game and the graphics,
Is tiddles going to shit all over my garden who thought it would b good for a cat game gamming gone done the pan,
I was thinking and hoping the game was like Journey where it tells a story without verbal communication to leave you wondering what happened and get you to peice the story for yourself. Oh well. I still love it anyways.,
"I'm playing this too, was very satisfied pawing all the balls into the pockets on the snooker table :D",
Robot pee is stored in metal ballz,
i hope you continue the until dawn series!,
Landed at our feet? Must an asteroid.  Literally talking about the sun,
I took a nap halfway through this and had a dream the momo character turned out to be some fat weeaboo dude,
"Watching him hit all the same beats Evelyn (sp?) did (""big stretch,"" worried about his limp, knocking down the cans) is beyond wholesome.",
8:47 The gasp heard around the world 😢,
"Jack going ""ohhh big stretch "" is ALL humans",
"my guess is the tiny robo was human at one point and it was dying. so, they put themself in a digital state of suspension. the world ended and a power failure stopped the backup part way through, then lost all the memories they've had as a human.",
"45 minutes in and here's my lore guess. Some disease that only affects humans or everything except cats infected the Earth. Humans tried to stop it by making the cities with big walls and possibly ceilings but it got in anyways. Human's last ditch effort to survive the disease was transferring their consciousness into robots hence the ""I hope this works""  and how all the robots act and dress like humans.  Part of me wants to think that the robots are scared of the cat because the cats can carry the disease, But that wouldn't make sense because why would the robots be susceptible to it and The Guardian said something about not seeing your kind before. Maybe the place at the start is where all the cats are and you're the only cat to come down?  B12 seemed to at least know you were a cat while The Guardian didn't know what you are. Perhaps the robots are just generally scared of things they don't understand, Which would make sense because of the ""as long as you don't eat anyone""  Implying something that kind of looked like a cat had eaten at least one robot.  I also would kind of think that by how B12 spoke about the backpack?  They didn't say it was for cats they said it was  Quadrupeds,  So maybe there's like dogs or some other 4 legged creature that's much more aggressive to robots?🤔🤔 I'm assuming that you'd have to be a similar size or that the backpack is Adjustable?  I guess considering how  B12 can like dematerialize objects or something I guess it would make more sense that the backpack is adjustable.  Anyways this game has cool world building I'm excited to see how it goes.",
"Oh Jack my boy I am sorry to tell you but Gab let’s play it’s just the best thing I saw on her channel sorry to tell you but I’m gonna watch it on her channel I still love you you are my golden boy oh Jackie boy saw the 
Game grumps special anniversary 10 years and it was the sweetest and coolest k I’m just smoking weed and continue watching stray",
Play FH5 hot wheels?,
"I’m not even a cat owner (having a bird instead) and even I mentally said “big stretch” at 3:14 

I’m starting to think it’s just a universal thing for all animals now 😅",
When he gets into the actual city it reminds me of little nightmares 2,
My heart strings are being pulled and I don’t even like cats,
This is gonna be hell for my cat to listen to,
Ok jack you must have the bebe in room for this game play this is disrespect to cats without a bebe present!!!,
"Sooooooo, am i the only one that notices the cat statues everywhere and the cat toys in the laundromat? Lol",
the translation on the wall where the robots are cozied in blankets speaking of the sun and seán mentally translating that as “the disease had to have come on an asteroid!” really got me,
the writing does look a lot like some Korean letters 😂,
How much did you pay for this the store says $30 but it says with premium,
"Great game, Cats, robots and of course NO  FILTHY  MEATBAGS!",
WHERES UNTIL DAWN,
"Humanity being dead, gets my juices flowing as well!",
"Because this is a cat game and my cat is an orange guy too, a lil story: had a vet emergency on Saturday. All Friday Tiger (dats his name) was sick. Threw up his meals. Didn't want to eat. (He's pretty vocal about his food, and food-driven so like…yeah no somethin up.) Got worried of course. Took him to vet. Vet gave him fluids. Tiger within 30 minutes at home screamed at me for food. Blood results just came back (did them cuz he's 10/11, so like a lil older). Kidney disease? No.

Literally my cat was fine except for his electrolytes. Tiger went to the vet because he didn't drink enough water, and throwing up didn't help. $400 down the drain cuz he's a silly cat.🤦‍♀

But he is fine and in good health now. Especially after watching the video with me. Lol",
The beginning of this game def. reminisced to tomb raider.  Was def. waiting for some kind of lost treasure hunt.,
PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PART 2 PLEASE I BEG,
1:36:39 Isnt that the importance of being idle- oasis?,
While i was waching your vid i saw a add for the game,
Oh my god this game is making me stressed,
Sean with the cheeky B99 reference,
Your cat(BB) will be proud of you.,
I have deemed my cat Sir meows a lot of cyber city,
"i just looked up the game and it was created by BlueTwelve studios, so B-12 is a cute little easter egg",
My cat is deeply invested in this game,
omg i didnt know you'd play this can't wait to watch!,
I think that you can stop the music robot by pressing triangle,
How much y'all wanna bet it dies?,
Had to pause 2 seconds in to not spoil it. Downloading it meow.,
"Sean... ""A natural light from a star that landed at our feet and gave warmth""... they're talking about the sun",
Has Jack played hollow knight?,
"Well Jack, you can consider cat's meow as a human's ""Oi"", its meanings are more depended on the scenario and the tone, so learning the mood they are in is a good way to know what they mean.",
I hope the other cats are ok too because I’m about to cry,
"20:22 oh hey, it's Cathan Break from uncharted",
"I've been watching you since the first couple of months you uploaded, I'm really happy to see you still playing game the way you used to, but I also wanted to recommend a game to you. It's the game Gato roboto, a game my friend plays a lot, it's literally metroid as a cat. Happy days, man",
i am your cat ... i to see the stuggle out here and think i will just die its fine,
Jack loves cats and i do to and that game is one of my favorites suprisingly,
I have no clue why but the second I saw the cat and started controlling him I named him Razor. I don't know why. It just felt right,
The BEST part was the cat's reaction after the backpack got put on.,
"did they use ""The Last of Us""  game level as the backdrop for this game ?",
"I just got this game today!
My computer CANNOT handle these graphics, even at the lowest settings. But it’s great anyway. I encountered a few bugs. But i suppose the games only been out for two days.",
What the hell I literally just saw an ad for this game and now this video is in my recommended,
Oh my gosh this video just got rid of all my childhood trauma,
We are all truly here to enjoy our lovable feline friends (and Jack of course),
This is an adorable game. I love kitties and have two of my own. I love that this is totally from the cats point of view. I will definitely get this game.,
This is rainworld,
Purr purr am cat 😺,
"""As a cat owner myself..."" Jack is definitely a cat n00b.  You are the servant, Jack.  You are owned.  Enjoy!  ;)",
Who is bb?,
Not being rude but I miss the old sean were he always swore and was loud and had green hair,
The jacks of us,
Day 4 of asking Jacksepticeye to finish Not For Broadcast.,
"""If you lick it, it'll go away.""",
I feel like I’m the only one who just cried when the cat fell 🥺,
"This game reminds me too much of Little Nightmares, I'm always expecting a jump scare lol",
"Jack's truly made it. Once he makes a video, 20 other YouTubers make one. I love Eddie, Mully, and all of them but none of them will ever be Jack",
"The cat flopping over and hating the backpack thing is incredibly silly to me lol

Also, Sean, the star that leaked light that landed at their feet was the Sun. I believe that writing is supposed to help give a perspective on just how long the city has been sealed over, as the writing speaks as though the Sun, an everyday thing for us, is like some sort of mythical tale as old as time that they don't really know whether truly exists or not.",
"I can't watch this, want to save it for my own playthrough, I come bak",
"Now I want to appreciate my cat more




If I had one",
"Dude I literally just started watching this and when I cat fell I literally started crying, I’m scared of what else this has in store for my sensitive heart",
OMG this adorables! Love you embracing your inner cat in the gameplay! =^.-.^=,
I had to stop at the part when the cat fell because I could not take that.,
"First thing I thought about when I saw is the environment is Hong Kong's walled city Kowloon, I don't know anything about the development of the game, but I'd wager that a lot of inspiration was taken from that city. This explains a lot of the asian influenced environment aspects as well as the fact that the alphabet looked vaguely similar to korean to you. Kowloon walled city was demolished many years ago. We used to have a replica in Kawasaki, Japan, but that is now closed too recently.",
I’m gunna go to sleep I’ll be back in the morning 30:19,
Jack you had to give the poncho to Elliot,
Intros are for nerds,
Catsepticeye,
jack talks about his cat  :the game,
where cute dog game at,
"Finds last notebook

B-12:”Huh there’s a note in this book”

Me: I wonder why hmm 🤔",
when the cat fell at the start is it bad that I laughed at the cat textures then laughed at the cats little scream when it fell,
"Had to call my cat to me, cuddles where needed immediately",
violently quick into,
"Jack is a true cat dad, marvelous.",
Mom😢,
Jack being a cat lover now fills be with joy,
"Jacks anguish when the car feel and started limping matched my own, I felt so bad.",
This video has my cat going wild tho,
It's weird that a cat would need torchlight even tho they have literally Night Vision. Just saying,
I own the six cats so this is very cute,
"36:07 My theory on this is that the robot ur with is the scientist and doesn’t know, successfully transferring its mind in the robot, or the scientist failing to transfer, leaving the robot companion alone.",
"I love cats THIS is awesome , thanks so much for all these vids, lots of love",
The things at 18:46 look like snarks from half life and I only remember that cuz you can feed one in Alyx,
"1:22:29
Two billion five hundred and forty-four million eight hundred and seventy-five thousand five hundred and fifty-six.
In other words, six million nine hundred seventy-two thousand two hundred and sixty-seven point eight years.(6,972,267.8)",
Oh I loved this game the moment I saw previews of it,
He did it he did the meme,
I JUST BOUGHT THIS GAME YESTERDAY!,
I just did a full playthrough before watching anyone else cuz as a cat owner of 4 I instantly wanted to start it,
29:58 this man really looked directly at the batter and asked where it was lol,
what cats (the movie) wishes it was,
I hade a cat named Bibi to i loved her so mutch but we hade to give her away. I hade my heart broken on the way to drop her of she was meowing the way. I miss her so mutch but i hope she is living her best life.😔,
"1:18:37  Cats everywhere: ""Now you know what it's like.  Tell the rest of your people.""",
"6:31 what Jack said here reminded me of Love, Death and Robots. If you know you know.",
You make us so happy Sean thank you for being here.🤍,
mrrr?,
it sucks that the ending of this game is so sad :( at least the cat is Alive :(,
"Can you imagine the developers just watching their pet cats do anything and quickly writing down notes
Or they put a lil backpack on one of their cats and recorded how it walked",
"Jack: Im a cat not a natural disaster

My cat also meowing and screaming pretty much just for the hell of it-",
IVE BEEN SO EXCITED FOR THIS YAYY,
"our cat falls to what may be death and the other cats do the most cat thing possible, they watch",
Purrrrrfect game,
Kinda wierd that Jack did almost everything except the main quest,
"The big stretch part, so true.",
"I hope you continue to play this game, not only is it so calming, who wouldn’t want to be a orange cat😂😂😂",
Apparently the main cat was based off of one of the creators actual cats,
This game lookss good,
No offense but damn it was hard seeing you anxious about missing music after you gave one of the sheets away and all you needed to do was buy the last one,
"I was worried I was getting to the end but there’s still 50 mins left hooray!!! I hope this becomes a SUUUPER long series, I’m absolutely in love with this game already",
They made a game that looks like its from ep2 of Death Love and Robots.... I'm in love! Cats shall rule the world!,
"""It was just a cat Hannah""",
red cat redemption,
He sounds like me when i play a game with excellent graphics or i get attached to a pet in a game that the pet ends up dying anyway. When that happens i turn into reekid  and i just wanna throw my playstation. Shaun ur so wholesome.,
I just want to know if he’s going to upload more until dawn so I should know if I should watch the old series,
My fiancé showed me this game yesterday and I can't wait to play it! I have a cat that looks exactly like this one but mime is a chonker!!,
A group of adult cats is a clowder.,
"When jack said hi to Momo it sounded alot luke how he said hi im conner and i cant get that hi outta my head so now i hear ""hi im cat sent by cat life",
"Game: ""What is a star near the earth that gives light and warmth, and helped plants grow?""
Jack: ""A meteorite with a virus.""",
"My cat Molly would definitely survive the apocalypse. She is cute and vocal and fluffy and loves everyone, so no one would want to harm her. 

She is also a merciless killer with surgically precise murder mittens and can move at the speed of light. When hunting mode is activated, she is an unstoppable force.  

Just ask the mice (and that one vole that one time) she brings into the house because she thinks we're incapable of feeding ourselves so she brings dinner home for us. She brings them home alive so we can practice our hunting. (Other than that one vole that one time.)",
"i thought this was just a cute cat simulator so that first cutscene caught me off guard. i'm so glad he didn't stay hurt long or i might have actually had a breakdown. as it stands i just surprise cried. (i have always lived closely with cats and have experienced several cat deaths that devastated me, so i was not prepared to watch a cat get hurt like that again)",
"This game is absolutely perfect for Jack's attention span, sadly it's slightly irritating to watch him play it.",
"Welcome to ""countdown to whenever this game makes Jack cry.""
It's bound to happen.",
"1:33:00 ""you guys at home will remember"" but Jack I also have ADHD...",
he passes the last battery he needs so many times it kills me.,
Meow,
It's soo cute,
"This I THE GAME for me, I cried the first minute 10/10 would recommend",
"Thank you, you just calmed my mind when I couldnt find anything else to do so. Thank you...",
this is amazing. so much time/thought went into the coding of this it looks like,
Is it just me or do the ads from youtube get more annoying and come more often nowdays ?,
"Man, I was hoping to put this on while I multitasked, but I just had to put everything down and experience the immersion of those gorgeous graphics!",
"At roughly 24:40 Jack talks about this being a game people just need, I totally agree. This last week I caused ~$20k or more in damages at work and ill tell you, this game was awesome to just turn my brain off to and just let the stress melt away.",
The language looks a bit like korean and some chinese characters mixed in too.,
Scary game,
"Kind of sad that not even Jack said Catman, he likes to get on the highground",
This reaminds me of how he reacted to the last guardian or is that just me?,
"Ive had alot of cats come and pass away
So downloading this game",
Jacks gonna get yelled at so much,
29:55 I thought you were messing with us,
I love games with such amounts of freedom - it’s always a joy to perceive,
Currently downloading the game .. cannot wait!,
AHHHH SO HAPPY THIS GAME IS FINALLY OUT,
"I think the ""soft ones"" meant more so of the flesh, not of the weak of emotion. And the ""natural light that helped them grow"" is probably the sun light, not the infection.",
"46:26
It be the sun Sean. It's a star that beams out light and hits the earth's surface, and it is warm, because it be sun",
So this is heaven!,
In the first few minuets this is reminding me of the last of us p2,
"It’s also really interesting, we have robots like these, that are sentient and kind of have emotions, and then you have the robots from Detroit Become Human. It’s also funny because he brought up Markus, which he called Robo-Jesus. I think it’s all coming together.",
I see jacksepticeye on poppy play time,
Hey jack the second episode is blocked,
"Game idea! An Alien Isolation type game following the first Alien movie. You play as Ripley's cat, Jonesy.",
Just got a new kitten just before the game came out. Love my tiny kitty.,
Dog's are better but cats are ok,
"""OH I CAN JUMP HIGH""
Me who has observed my cat making a 6ft verticle jump before; yeah they do that",
Paid ?,
God of war ragnarok is on  ps4 or ps5 now I wonder if jacks gonna play it,
30:36 me screaming ITS RIGHT THERE!,
"Jack: ""I only have 4?!? Oh my god there's so many more lying around out there!""
... meanwhile there are only 2 he has to find and 1 he has to buy 💀",
"8:56

""Fly you fools!",
"Also, Jack keeps talking about the Outside like he's never been there. Didnt the cat fall down into the flat from the Outside??",
has anyone ever seen love death plus robots episode three robots?,
im soooo ready for like an 18 part series,
It’s been a while since I’ve seen a game where you play as evil incarnate 😂,
"So glad you're playing this!! When I started my playthrough I literally said I hope Jack plays this game, he'll definitely love the lighting and environments. Thanks for all the amazing content over the years! 🥰",
"My brother just told me that this game came out and then I saw this, and I understood immediately what game it was so I click",
"As the favored human servant of a purrboi I can say with confidence, that the most unrealistic part of this game is the kittykitty listening to requests",
Its also 40C here in Canada and it's really humid too DX,
I have a theory for why the language is unreadable to the player. You're a cat. Cats tend to not know how to read.,
44:55 usually to quarantine something you want to keep it in,
"Translation: natural light that leaked from a star and landed at out feet. This light caused warmth and well-being in our ancestors; it helped them grow
Me: Ahhhh so sun light
Jack: So it’s an infection that landed on their feet
😭😭😭",
"What’s funny is this game is practically made for people with ADHD to play, with the little side quests and mini games you can play. From the knitting of the poncho, to the bag on the cat, and so on. Yes, they nailed the behavior of the cat, but as a person with ADHD, I think it’s also good for people who also have it to play Stray. I dunno, I’m just rambling. The point is, it’s nice to see Jack playing this and having so much fun with it, as he himself has ADHD.",
i was just about to get the game then i saw this video so i have to check it out first,
"6:27 Love Death + Robots, anyone?",
Just as Jack said “oh it’s raining” it started down-pouring outside my house 😹,
The title should be Jack fan girling about cats for 1:42:18 😂,
"No shit we’re called the soft ones, everyone these days is just so sensitive about pretty much everything.",
"Not for me, but enjoy the game.  It’s beautiful and probably fun, but too short and very little replay potential.  Great Video.",
Jack being a cat dad for 1 hour and 42 minutes,
the end of the game is so sad,
I need a compilation of jack gushing over graphics,
"Jack: I bet the outside isn't even livable anymore

The outside from the start of the game: you bet wrong",
"Since no one else answered this:

Vitamin B-12 (cobalamin) plays an essential role in red blood cell formation, cell metabolism, nerve function and the production of DNA, the molecules inside cells that carry genetic information. Food sources of vitamin B-12 include poultry, meat, fish and dairy products.",
When he said when all humanity dies I thought in my mind  they do have 9 lives,
Just got back from Drum Camp to find Jack-a-boy uploaded my favorite game. A delightful surprise.,
As a cat owner i have to play it,
Bought it! ♥ ♥ ♥,
im sure you've seen this a million times but the pancho is for elliot,
Me over here kissing my kitty,
"LETS GOOOOOOOOOOO, RIGHT 
AFTER I POSTED THE COMMENT",
"Jack: *starts talking about lighting*
Me: *infamous second son flashbacks*",
I highly recommend Jack to get into Warriors if he loves this game and cats in general,
now cat want hurt me :(,
I feel like Im cheating myself bc I wanna play it before watch you play but Im not gonna be home for like a month. And its so hard to not watch bc I was so excited for this game,
I have this game and genuinely have no idea what's going on. I'm just hehe cat! Fuck the story. Cat.,
Also good video keep it up,
"Hey, Jack I know this is totally off-topic but, will you be playing the full version of they are here alien abduction horror when it comes out in 2023?",
I like how I needed to stop watching and exactly at 20:00 and was when everything was calm again like a checkpoint area,
"Jack: “beautiful graphics”
Me: “ wait is that a body?”
12:00",
"The sun is a star

🤣",
"Video: is #1 on trending for gaming
Me: AS IT SHOULD BE
Nine minutes in, and we already have sad scene.",
I miss my cat. RIP shadow ❤️. 15 years was too short.,
This is one of the only games I want to 100%,
I no I'm having you some box fan big enough to turn a small cat into hamburger meat,
*_I can already see speedruns…_*,
Please make more tomorrow I'm so invested,
Me waiting for you to continue your replay of Until Dawn: 👁👄👁,
spoiler alert: midtown and anttown this are citys you will future explore,
did they use the pink trombone to use as the robots voices? I heard it in momos voice a lot,
For some reason this game seriously reminds me of the three robots episode from love death and robots.,
my previous cats name was Bibi she is dead i miss her,
1:37:36 sounds like spider dance from undertale,
Cat owners like me and jacksepticeye love and like everything about cats. I am friendly to cats and most cats can tell I am friendly and let me pick them up.,
Jack by the way the outside is where you started at the beginning of the game cause you were able to see the sky,
I'm dying because of cuteness,
"I guess the place your mind went when expecting shitty visuals was goat/deer simulator.

Meanwhile the rest of us where thinking Triko (toriko) since the first 5 seconds

Ps. anyone else counting the times he almost falls, you know because of the whole 9 lives thing...",
I really wish I could share pics here cause my kitty Patches was watching Jack play the whole time. Can't wait to watch the other videos with him!,
"Omg that's exactly my husband. He's a dog lover and I'm a cat lover. We got 2 cats though and he's incredibly in love with them. I hate the stereotype people give cats, that their evil, cats love just as much as dogs do. Every animal loves you just gotta treat them with love as well.",
Is it just me or did the part at the beginning where the cat fell as the other cats looked at you reminded me of the Lion King,
"As much as I want to experience this game myself, I can help but to watch and adore the game and Sean's gameplay/commentary",
Kitty kitty kitty kitty 😺 rocking everywhere 😺😺😺💖,
"30:05 Jack not seeing the battery hurt my soul, I didn't see the other ones but I saw that one immediately",
what BB is saying is give food now food food give,
"Cat game, game about cat",
My cat and I thoroughly enjoyed this. Ten toe beans out of ten.,
"I actually knew a cat that would fake a limp whenever he made someone angry to make them feel bad. Cats are smart when they want to be, never when it’s to your benefit though.",
Fun fact the vitamin B12 can make mosquitoes and black flies not bight you at all or a little bit less,
Now we just need Jack with Bebe playing this game,
"This reminds me of the aristocats, Everybody wants to be a cat, because the cats the only cat who knows where it's at",
Its like the Last of us but cats,
"Me when person falls into an abyss during a game: ah, you're fine, walk it off

When a cat falls: NOOoOO you're ok, my heart can't take this, your gonna be fine, don't die, it's gonna be ok",
"@13:18 jack talks about how cats chitter at birds, and then kind of mimicked a bird call with meows, I just put together that they do that because cats instinctively hunt birds",
Call the cat Cali for calico,
I would watch cat videos with Sean.,
so has any one else spotted QR codes on TV advert channels on game that convert to binary,
genuinely think this game was made for jack! great lighting and... cats and its a ginger cat since he is irish 😎 AND A BUCKET,
"Is anyone going to tell him that he gave the 5/8 sheet to the musician


Na he may find out by him self",
"Fur baby Supremacy, Jack is a cat dad",
Omfg dude you played it too? I just binged through it and finished in like 8 hours. Honest to god it made me cry. You will love it!!,
Love how Sean just casually disses BB by saying he wouldn't even attempt to survive in a post apocalypse,
THIS IS THE KIND OF CONTENT I NEED TO SEE RN ☝️,
"I'm a cat owner myself of two fur babies, a loaf named Ziggy and a Diva/Queen Maisy and they are just the cutest little things I've ever had. This is absolutely incredible, 100/10 in the first minute of watching this

Add on - I'm watching this with both my cats and everytime they hear the meow, they perk up to look for the sound",
"I love this, holy moly!!",
Speaking if Nathan drake jack should play uncharted again. I’d love to see a revisit of that series,
What if the robot is the scientist and that wierd white pod thing has his body inside it. But its been so long so he forgot who he was,
"Anyone else see the thumbnail and just go
Warrior cats..........",
"i just watched the end of the last of us 2 on your channel and a s soon as i turn on the video "" it's not the last of us it's the cats of us""",
how could a live stream get so many views,
"""The ancient stories speak of natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet. The light caused warmth and well-being in our ancestors; it helped them to grow"" That sounds like they're describing the sun.",
THE NEW GENERATION BABY THE FUTURE IS NOW,
That was the best intro you’ve ever done 😂😂,
"i've been waiting for this for so long, it looks so cute 😭",
46:30 the sun,
Don't worry the poncho is part of the main quest. Also the button is somewhere of the cats bag thing.,
"Watching Jack react to the weird gross crab things 

Me who has finished the game: *oh you got a big storm coming*",
"perfectly timed! was debating on buying this game because i usually dont like spending money on things i wont enjoy or games that are over too soon, so watching you play the beginning will definitely help me decide if i want to buy it or not!",
"*Gasp* I havent started the video yet; is this that cat game I heard about where you go around solving crimes as a gang of cats?

Edit: I have officially named the main cat Kai. His brothers that he was separated from are Cole (the black one), Zane (the white one), and Jay (the red/white one).",
"Its not a backpack, its a catpack lol",
Just watched it it’s been 10 hrs since posted and I already want another vid immediately,
this video is good yes,
I want this game on the Switch so bad,
This may be the best series yet. Please lets play this game 110%. I need this.,
Cat are my favorite animal,
I need it 😭,
idk the lore can some one fill me in?,
My 3 year old son and I watched this earlier on the tv… we need this game lol,
We should get a bb cam while jack plays this series:),
it was the sun jack,
The intro reminded me of tunic a game in love but it's very hard to play,
Jacksepticat,
The perfect game doesn't ex...,
"First of all, good to know I'm not the most crazy cat person, thanks Jack. Second, I've got a (oldish) spotted white-belly tabby and a six-year-old black cat, both from the same shelter and I SWEAR, THE GAME ONES LOOK LIKE OLIVER AND LUKE. Like, down to Oliver's tail spot",
First 10 mins of the video and it made me cry 😂,
"I love this game, i also just started",
I love how jack says “Biiiiiigggg Stretch every time the cat stretches.,
I played this game yesterday and my first thought was “Jack would love this game” and here we are,
It's what's left of the world after it re terraformed itself after SOMA,
the record for denmarks heat was also broken the same day,
i almost cried when the cat fell the first time,
"Highly recommend this game to everyone. BEAUTIFUL story, I want a Stray 2. Storyline is reallyyyy interesting and the gameplay is horrifying and beautiful.",
"I just got this game yesterday, I've been waiting soo long for its release, and I LOVE IT!! I'm going to finish it before watching Sean's gameplay. When I started playing, I immediately thought, ""Sean would love this."" I definitely wasn't surprised this morning when I saw his recent upload haha.",
This game was so refreshing. I'd love to see a sequel. The robot and cat dynamic in this world has a lot more storytelling potential imo,
"for the record, 2,544,875,556 days is just under 7 million years.",
"This is such a cool game, the main character looks like the best cat I ever had Jasper",
I love this it makes me think of warrior cats,
I loved the start because its just facts,
Stopped watching almost immediately because I already got attatched to it and can’t bear to see anything bad happen to it or any other cat,
"You know how you were playing Stray the game right now? There was a commercial, of the same game!",
So now I can't watch you OR Gab??? I eventually want to play this (if it comes down in price or goes on a super sale) and don't want spoilers. 😭😭,
"I’m gonna be 110% with y’all. I bawled my eyes out when the cat got separated from its family, I’m talking ugly sobs and hiccups while holding my cat. I’m a bit emotional to say the least :,)",
If the ending is not the cat reunited with their friends I’m going to sentimentally die,
OOH I heard about this game. I can’t play it though.,
I already want more.,
im at the 7th minute of this vid and the compound is giving me maze runner vibes,
1:22:27 thats 6.9 (nice) million years...,
I can relate because i have a couple cats and they are pretty chaotic but its worth it because they love me which is a rare occurrence when owning a cat,
"Writing on the wall speaking about the sun:
Jack: maybe it was a disease",
I literally just finished re-watching your The Last Guardian playthrough so this is amazing,
I got this game today and decided to start playing when I got home. Intended to play through the intro and get started then go to bed since I have work in the morning. Only planed on playing a few minutes right. I started playing at about 8:20 ish. It is now 12am. This game is an absolute delight and I can't put it down. Will I be exhausted in the morning? Yes. Is it worth it? Absolutely.,
"i’ve not heard one single negative comment about this game (apart from that one annoying trophy😂), as a cat lover im so happy this game is doing so well! disappointed with how short it was, about 5 hours BUT the graphics, the movement, everything is amazing! quality over quantity 🐈",
"Am I the only one who at the part when kitty fell and Jack got emotional I was waiting for seàn to scream ""BB COME HERE I NEED YOU HERE TO HOLD YOU FOR EMOTIONAL SUPPORT!!!"" 🤣",
Hey Jackaboy can't wait for part 2.....😁 you rock😎,
I WANT UNTIL DAWN!!,
when the cat fell i actually almsot started crying I cant play this game,
Anyone else's cats actually sit and watch this one mine were pawing and meowing back at the cats on screen,
"Wow, the start of this game is just like Rain World.",
where is until dawn,
Hate cats they are useless creatures but glad to watch this game it's really an interesting thing to see in a development point of veiw tho still hate cats they can be pet food it's the only use iv seen in the mistakenly made creatures sorry not srry,
That ain't a backpack that's a catpack,
what happened to the redo of until dawn?,
the fact that jack didnt understand that the light that would come from a star and come to the soft one's feet was just the sun😭😭💀,
The number of days that the humans were gone is almost 7 million years,
More!,
You- you missed the chance to say meowtrix 💀,
"The long awaited sequel to “press Y to honk”
“Press 🔘 to meow”",
the game has only been out for like an day or 2. and i have already beaten it..... i need help,
"heya jack, sorry you have been feeling a bit down. just thought id let you know that iv been binging your vids recently and they have been really making me happy! Iv been searching for a job an its been nice to have company of sorts. Hope you feel better soon!",
"I’ve been in a funk too. I broke my tooth, can’t get into the dentist for a week so eating is a bitch! My I’ve been having more panic attacks recently alongside depression and my dr is talking about taking me off my adhd meds which is only making it worse bc I was finally starting to feel better it’s just sometimes I go through phases. But this game has really been helping. I wish I had a ps5 so I didn’t have to live it vicariously through you and gab. It’s funny I’m 100% a dog person, I like cats , I just prefer something a lil needier lol (that doesn’t pop inside the house, I despise a litter box). I do have a kitty. And this game is making me want to work on our bond a bit more. (She’s always been super independent, and skittish except for me, so I just leave her be and let her come to me when she wants. But now I feel like hunting her down and bribing for affection.)  Lol",
jack i love your hat,
"I absolutely adored this game. I saw it last night on my Google feed and thought about tweeting it at Jack. However, the next day he had already uploaded the video of stray. He was already one step ahead. I love this man & I hope to continue enjoying the rest of the videos that he does. 💚",
This is just the cutest!!! 🥹🥹❤️,
I wish I could play but it’s not on Xbox 🥺,
Jack did you know there’s an achievement if you meow 100 times,
"I was playing through this game and i literally thought to myself ""this is Jack's kinda game"" and sure enough he did a video on it 😂😂😂😂",
Can't wait to see the speedrun strats.,
Jacks reaction to anything cute the cat did warmed my heart,
"Now, ecuse moi i need to pet my cat",
Oooohhhhhhh I HAVE SEEN THIS GAME ON TIKTOK LIKE WEEKS AGO! IM SO EXCITED😆,
"Jack: Can I sprint?

Also Jack: Pushes the meow button


Jack's eyes: O_O",
"Jack, since you like worlds set in this kind of apocalypse, please try out the metro franchise, it’s set in a world similar to this",
YESS! ive seen some stuff about this game on tiktok but since i cant play it myself ive been waiting for someone else to play it on yt,
"This game has major little nightmares energy, I love how the game never makes that cat so you can always just make up a name, mine is Callisto",
b 12 r energy pills i take one every day,
I think he’s doing a part two Fast #1 trending for gaming,
13:24 <---- press over and over,
I have dog,
"I’m really not into cats , see in the neighborhood that I’m from we have a cat problem . They tend to tear up Gardens & crap everywhere & the only thing we as the neighborhood are allowed to do is use humane traps to catch them & take them to the nearest animal Shelter & if someone dose not claim them in 10 days I think they put them down but don’t quote me on that , they may not do that anymore I really don’t know . All I know is that they’re not in my neighborhood anymore & I don’t have to deal with them tearing up stuff & craping everywhere . I think there should be a law that if you own any animal you should be a responsible owner & take the necessary steps to keep your pet from doing damage to other peoples property .",
Humans don't deserve animals lol,
Is that the path our parents walked to school on,
i hope this is not a self promotion but i am as well playing this but also made a stream or two but i now have to record gameplay since my brother Vopro is uploading a video to his channel and we share the same modem,
"Ughhhhhhhh!!!!! Not fair!!!! I so want to play this game, but like all my favorite YouTubers are beating me too it!!!! I want the game, but I don't want to be spoiled!!!!! Ughhhhh! Choices! Choices! Choices!",
My cat is following me around right now,
This was painful to watch. He missed so much and was so oblivious to things In his face.. the last music sheet was the one he needed to buy and he looked for like 15 minuets after he had bought the wire. And then the battery was right in his face.,
Petition to name the cat Rusty. After a certain cat in a fictional book series...,
My friend's cat is an accordion.,
This game making me miss my cat back home. Couldn't bring her over when I initially moved to the UK because the company I was using fell through so I have to wait until September and I miss her like crazy! At least I have this fake cat to get me through...,
hey jack ijust wanted to tall u that u do go back to that area and the scarf is used later in the story so udont have to go looking for who needs it,
I love Jack saying “oooh big stretch” is great because I swear any car owner says that,
"Thanks for this.

Hopefully I can play one day.",
"Just watched gab play yesterday and so excited you are now playing to, I already love this game so much, imo it's game of the year.",
"Dude, Jack… you’re a cat! Explore!!! Please!!! You’re missing little bits/hints of story and certain things I won’t say yet that you’ve already missed some of.",
"Hey jack I know that you'll probably not see this but I would REALLY recommend a game called Control as it has aspects of grandeur, mystery, larger than life forces, beautiful visuals and some goofy stuff. Anyways keep up the great videos!",
I'm on holiday and this made me miss my cat at home,
"34:35

B-12: ""Is it uncomfortable?""
Protagonist Cat: is fucken ded",
I love the LITER of cat puns in this play through already,
"Trico: Was I, the cat dog bird creature, nothing to you? :'(",
why no until dawn part 3 ?,
"I played this game through in one sitting, it is phenomenal from start to finish and I'm excited to watch this run without fear of spoilers.",
I see what Jack means with ff7. Also it's Midgar. But yes absolutely love cats. This game resonates so well with audience 😊,
I’ve finished it 3 times already but I’ll still watch Seàn play it,
Not all cats wait for 10 mins before jumping mien jumps imidiotly,
"I watched evelyns first video and its cute how you both say ""big stretch"" and ""drinky"" <3",
24:14 It’s the Pur-fect kind of game,
At13 seconds in look at his face,
"""Everyone should play this game""
If I could I would but it's only on PlayStation so I cant",
the poncho was supposed to go to the robot elliote then he says he can fix something for you which is a tracker That's what you missed out on.,
"""natural light that leaked from a star and landed on our feet"" is referencing our sun, or alternatively, their sun.",
"Jack when starting up the game: yay tiny lil kitty cat!
Jack less than 6 minutes into the game: I am ready to SLAUGHTER",
2:36 Brooklyn 9-9 reference 😊,
There is no way possible sme1 who loves cats will leave this game untouched it's a dream game for cat lovers,
Jack you should play Ghost Runner the entire story takes place under enormous super City size Tower.,
Yes baby,
"I love the moment of ""oh thank God I don't have to watch this cute little Kitty limp anymore"" 🤣🤣🤣",
"First Evelyn and BB, now Sean. This game is just made for them",
"5 and a half minutes in and i am already going to download this, thanks!

i _really_ love the overgrown ruins of civilization aesthetic too, i am so glad we get to see it on this kinda level now. side note, 10 minutes in and this just looks like rainworld 2 with less slug and more cat, and that is the best endorsement i could ever give to a game.",
Watched Gabs play it. Glad your checking it out,
"Alarm going off
Jack: is this Korean",
It reminds  me of the Lion  king that  part were  simba  dad fell off the cliff  bye  his  brother  scar  but your  character  is  not  dead  or killed  by your  siblings.,
I watched this 5 hrs after release and by the time I finished it was midnight. I had so much fun watching jack that I forgot what time it was.,
"Jack you are not a cat owner, the cat is a human owner.",
"Wait did Clementines soul from the walking dead go into a robot and lived forever. Damn, sure wish I could do that.",
You could put the contrast at 100% and brightness 100%,
"The Places and The details of how the areas look makes me
Think back to mace runner the books and the movies the wall reminds me of the wall of the maze",
Aww this game,
"""Robo...... Jesus"" 
Me: Markus???!?!?!?",
the ads every 5 minutes really enhance the experience,
the music she plays on the guitar is very jack johnson-esque and i love it,
Love it please keep doing this series❤️,
"Cat:*exists*
Jack:I would kill for you",
"The badge was on the cats pack
Just thought I’d mention that",
"What interested me was the robots and the setting mostly. Then Isaw cat and that u play as cat and im like ""NANI??!?"" but, I played the game and really enjoyed being a cat for some reason, and.. Started acting like one irl while playing kinda for some reason. And now I suddenly like cats more. Did cats make this game to brainwash me? Cis it's working",
I cannot wait for part two to be up,
"The zurks remind me of ticks, the way that they're shaped and also the fact that the cat scratches himself after he's attacked.. hopefully they don't give you a later consequence like tick fever but its something I thought of when I saw the robot being bundled up.. maybe some are sick",
Can we appreciate this game’s GORGEOUS ambient soundtrack? I’m in love,
Woohoo party times,
Damn they really pulled a Mufasa at the start.,
Am I the only one that started singing Stan? No? Just me? lol,
"Having finished this yesterday, it’s so interesting watching Jack’s expressions whilst he plays through it",
Bro I just had to go pet my cat while watching this😭😭🥺🙏,
"You're number one on trending, Jack!",
"why is the thumbnail almost the exact same as dan's and this video was uploaded a couple of hours later...
I'm not saying you did anything, I'm just a little confused...",
Yes! I hoping you going to play this because I can’t play it on Xbox,
can we acknowledge that this game came out yesterday and hes already got a banger out for us,
WTF I'm not watching this. Cat game exists. I must get it. I'm getting it right now.,
Yoooo October 11th is my birthday!!! 22:05,
my cat sat on my lap for about 10 minutes while watching this then clawed the crap out of me,
"I need the next part 
I am beyond invested in this lil kitty's journey",
Is it weird that one of my cats is the spitting image of the one in the game and happens to be named momo,
I’ve already watched multiple people play this game and the joy and smiles this game brings them makes me so happy. ☹️❤️,
"I pre ordered this game a few months ago AND I LOVE IT! tank you for making a video on it, and I hope we both have fun.",
You should read the titles of the books in the library 😂,
"that first part showint the cat behavior is SOOOOO acurate it's UNREAL. it shows off so much details you need to research to get that right, what an amazing feed in gaming! the behavior is arguably one of the most important parts to getting animals to look realistic and the developers have shown that they are MASTERS of it!",
This reminds me of Little nightmares 1 and 2 to be honest. Where the DEVS want u o explore the world and its lore and put together what happened to it.,
"Game: describes the sun
Jack: INFECTED ASTEROID",
Can't you finish one series before starting another? Now his re-playthrough of Until Dawn is gonna be swept under the rug...,
My car gets under my dresser and stays there idk how he fits he so fat,
I have a feeling that the robots are the humans with their consciousness implanted into the robot bodies. Like the movie Chappie. Might be wrong tho 😅,
The graphics are amazing even on the ps4 but I bet the haptic feedback from the ps5 adds to the experience. This is the first video game I’ve gotten my girlfriend to play and she’s enjoying it I’m excited to see what she thinks of it after finishing. Maybe she’ll want to give the last of us a play through?(she’s watched me play through both of them and loved the story),
"I’m sorry, but did he just growl back at 20:46???",
evelien and sean both saying BIIIIIG stretch whenever the cats stretch is so >>>,
YESSSSSSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!IM SO STOKEDDDDD,
"Play
OneShot",
I just realized the scratching mechanic is used to see if you’ve been in a location,
"This will be my favorite series on the channel, I love cats, and this is exactly what I wanted, a cat in a futuristic world, showing how if robots replaced humans, it would be hard for animals to find food and water, and the graphics are amazing, and I knew when this came out, you would play it, also, next episode of this, maybe name your cat? I'd call it Sam!",
"Ads literally every six minutes. Basically unwatchable.

Please fix. Really kills pacing when I get ads for Tide or Betfred literally, LITERALLY every six minutes.",
did anyone else hear the silent hill alarm going off in this video??,
"Jack: Oh no! Did I progress the game? 
Jack: * looks at the small windowsill that he could probably just go back through *
Jack: aw man. there's no way back :(
Jack: *goes down a zipline that doesn't go backwards *

Make no mistake, I love your videos, I just like poking a little fun here and there. I'm very excited to see where this cat goes next.",
"The soundtrack reminds me of ""It Takes Two"".",
i saw this game on steam and i was soo disapointed i couldnt play because my pc requirements were too low,
"I look at the cat, I look at my cat, and I look back at the cat, and I think... THEY'RE IDENTICAL!",
We require an appearance from CATSEPTICEYE.,
why that place look like breeze from valorant tho ???,
I love this game I started calling the cat Scout 💖,
Watching this with my cat,
This is what cyberpunk 2077 should have been,
"I'm such an American. He read Montpelier on the postcard and I was like, were they leaf peeping over in Vermont? xD",
A name I would give to the cat is Jaco,
There's another game that came out the same day you should play too! It's called Endling- Extinction is forever,
Plz we need no of this,
FOR THE LOVE OF YOUTUBE EASTER EGG!!! PLEEEAAASSSEEE call the cat avatar JAMBO for each video,
Jack has the same laugh as Andrew Garphield.,
My cat used my hand as a seat and watched the entire video start to finish while purring and kneading. I think she likes the game lol,
this is too heart wrenching i dont know if i can watch thhhiiisssss T-T,
I honestly forgot jack could speak Korean almost fluently,
"That opening scene really looks like my yard right now, rainy and there's a few cute kittys running around or hiding from the rain. Love the channel! Much love from Alaska!",
Look up free and green u will love the song,
In honor of Momo the cat's name shall be known as Outsider.,
The little robot looks like the cuddle fish from Subnautica,
"THIS is supposed to be a horror game lol
but cat to cute",
Im watching this with my cat judging by his reaction they used actual cats for the audio,
the game's design gives me pokemon colosseum vibes it's so cool,
Literally anything with cats is so cute and always catches my attention 😭 Cats are the best <3,
"and yes i immediately said ""big stretch"" just like i say ""big yawn""",
Sean needs big brain glasses,
"The camera nods at you! That is such a great detail! 22:41
The cat falling over is so accurate. >XD 34:33",
46:30 that poem sounds like the sun not the infection,
trying to watch a sneak peak while my game is downloading (i have super slow wifi),
Watch jack buy a cat after this game lmao....,
Anyone else get reminded of little nightmares? When Sean was walking just into the city with the moon light and buildings on each side broken down,
This universe is just the continuation of the story from Love Death & Robots.,
2:34 nice Brooklyn 99 quote,
I love this episode of Love Death + Robots,
Meow!!!!!!,
As someone who doesn't like cats this game is really cool,
I love how it took him forever to find that last battery,
Sean you are just the most adorable man to ever live. Please never change,
CODE RED I REPEAT CODE RED JACKS LOOSING BRAIN CELLS,
"My cat was missing and found passed yesterday, so this game was bittersweet for me and admittedly made me cry a lil 💕",
Dawn of the planets of cats! We need a movie now…like this second!,
"HWAPSHH, TOP O-...oh...okay...nevermind...",
"The music is fantastic, reminds me of FF7 in a way. So nice. This game is beautuful. Thank you for sharing!!
*Jack a few mins later: ""Wow, this reminds me of Final Fantasy 7.""*
(Me a few mins after I wrote this comment: Called it!)",
1:35 hehehe PURRfect 😄,
Stupidest fucking game i’ve seen.,
JACK YOU MISSED ALLLLLL THE BOTTLES TO KNOCK OVER!!!!! OMGGGG 1:01:00,
I need the OST for this game.,
jacksepticat,
I don't know about the rest but the first cut scene gives me unraveled vibes,
I ache every moment I am not looking at a cat,
"I just finished this game myself, and its a bit sad but I'm sure you'll love this game! :D Enjoy the utter cuteness this game brings",
"3:42 Beebee “I learned it from watching you, Dad! You scream and you get attention, why shouldn’t I?",
My heart broke a little when you said BB would rather die than survive in a world like this,
Want some catnip?,
The way he fell in love with the game and the cats is amazing. It’s so fitting that such a game would be so gorgeous to watch and play- including the kitties,
The fact this game is only on PS is quite upsetting and I won't stand for it,
"I'm sorry about your back Sean :( I often have back problems myself, and know the struggle and how it can affect the mental health too. gonna pray for you <3",
"I love jack being like ""I worked really hard for this detergent I deserve more for it"" when in reality the only hard part was that he got side tracked 🤣 like Jack love you - but you climbed up a building and meowd that could have taken a mf 2 minutes 🤣",
I also screamed when the cat fell down that pit. I was in emotional distress,
This reminds me of my cats I’m away from them at the moment but this is honestly perfect,
"When the cat falls: oh dear, oh dear gorgeous
When Nathan Drake falls: you f*cking donkey",
I litterally had a dream of this game and I was the cat many years ago,
"Jep, fucking done with youtube. Im sorry sean but this video is unwatchable. Trying to watch on my tv and i literally (no joke) get an ad every 3-4 minutes. It is utterly ridiculous. Cant even put down the remote",
I’m surprised he didn’t make an Argo reference when the cat didn’t make the jump in the beginning,
"""the battery is probably staring me right in the face"" as he says looking directly at the battery for the fourth time",
"Love this, it so cute 😍 
Pretty sure the poncho is for that tech robot, he was the only one nakey.",
3:12 LMAO EVELIEN SAID THE SAME EXACT THING,
"*""Istead Of The Last Of Us, It's The Cats Of Us.""*

I don't know why, but I found that funny lol! 😂😂😂",
"Jack: “My cat can’t climb on rooftops!” 

Me: “My cat climbs on my roof to sunbathe and take naps” 😂",
"I just finished the game and it was so good, experienced two glitches but thank GOD the game saves often. I loved loved it! Everything was just splendid. Ez puzzles that won’t make the gameplay annoying and the ambiance in general is just insanely good! Props to everyone who worked on this masterpiece",
"the writing is chinese or japanese, also when cats get used to an environment they can jump without thinking",
I've never seen a single trailer or announcement about this game. Neither did I hear anyone talk or see anyone write about it. Until yesterday when the cashier of the store I go to in every lunch break told me that she's excited to get home to play a new game.,
"i played this yesterday with my brother and i said, ""sean is definitely going to play this""... here we are.",
This reminds me of Warrior Cats despite not reading Warrior Cats,
"""Fly you fools!"" 8:51",
13:39,
I'm pretty sure the ones that take awhile before jumping are the chunky ones,
"I adore this game 🥰 Also, Jack, you can use the scratch marks as signs that you’ve been there! So let lil meow meow tear up the whole place!",
99!,
"Gross, they're robo ticks.",
Natural light that leaks from a star… hmm must be an asteroid. Couldn’t be the sun that’s too silly,
E,
Am I the only one having halo flash backs at 18:57?,
"I'm only on chapter 3 but, as someone who has had cats my entire life, they absolutely nailed the mannerisms of the cat.",
I love thiiiis. Very excited for this playthrough!!,
How are you able to talk so well?,
"Yes! Was so hoping you would play this game, can't wait to sit down and watch this game with you, it looks so nice from the trailers, so will enjoy your inputs on the lighting, shaders and texture, as well as the setting and story :)",
sat here the whole time and nearly passed out near the end great game and video<33,
Reminds me a lot of rain world,
I knew collecting my energy drink cans had purpose,
"Sins that you must repent of, repentance is you turning away from your sins, you must repent & turn away from these sins:
Sexual Immorality, Idolatry, anger, murder, (which is hatred) Effeminate, PRIDE/LGBTQ, stealing, Unforgivness, *MUST REPENT OF* False witness, Covetousness, Gossiping, drugs/Drunkenness!",
Don't cats have night vision? Why does it need a flashlight,
"I'm amazed that Sean managed to even leave the first little area. I was melting under the critical levels of _cute_ from the moment the tabby started playing with the black cat's tail, because _really,_ how can you *_NOT?_*",
This game has better graphics then cyberpunk,
"I haven't looked this up so idk but everything about the game makes me think it can be highly inspired on ""Three Robots"" from Love Death and Robots",
the small robots look like ticks!!!! possibly another small detail!,
"""Scar, Brother, Help me!""",
Also someone should make a compilation after jacks done with it and just make a compilation of him meowing and doing cat noises,
"nothing like watching this with a cat on my lap, *inside* my jersey, purring the fuck out, having the nap of her life.",
This game reminds me of rain world,
cant wait to see more of this!,
"Omg this is most coolest cat game the visual the graphics and details and the cats !!!  Also me and Sean  have same reaction 0:36 , 1:02 , 14:46 

Seeing the cat act cute and adorable and if we see a cat . But that's probably due to being bolth cat owners. Also I'm watching this beside my cat licorice. She heard cat meows and was curious about it.",
What happened to Until Dawn?,
"Boop the snoot.
I want to boop their snoot.
So cute, so soft.
Boop the snoot.",
I'd love to play this game but I'd have to wait to see if it comes out on xbox after a while 😭,
Not gonna lie. I'm a dog person and I dislike cats. But they opening sequence effin destroyed me... :(,
i got 3 mins and already im enjoying this way too much,
"43:25 ""i'm a cat not a natural disaster"".... Are you sure you own a cat Sean?????",
"46:12 Jack, that's just our sun.",
"1:09:10 i went ""aww thats so cute"" then jack said the same lmao. cats are too precious.",
God been waiting a long time for this game to come out and I’m so hyped you’re playing it! Watching it on my laptop though I’m too lazy to log in so: I just adore the little robot guy!,
Are you going to drop until dawn part 3 soon?,
that black cat looks and sounds exactly like mine except mines a little on the chonkier side,
I am seeing some real parallels between this game and Final Fantasy VII.,
Calling it now the robot was the scientist,
Jackscepticat. 😂,
"I've been watching this game and silently waiting for its arrival, I'm super exited for this! The cats are adorable :'>",
"All the people who made this game know what the people want right now, you just can’t go wrong with cats and robots 🤖 🐈💕",
You should play >Observer,
"My cat died yesterday, This game is reminding me of her so much. she was just like this cat.",
I watched Dan play the game first - and I was crying within the first 10 minutes and hugged my cat. This game is so adorable!,
"52:33 the cats vision gets blurry because cats actually can’t see things up close super well. Because their eyes are so large, it’s hard for them to focus on things up close like that. So that’s super cool that the game went that far into the characteristics and functions of cats.",
My cat literally broke her back leg in half and has to be amputated. So this game gives me anxiety as well,
120.2 Degrees F today !,
That was the quickest intro I’ve ever seen from jack,
THE CATS NAME IS MURTAUCH HIS NICKNAME IS “THE BOSS” HES BASED ON THE MAKERS CAT,
B12 is for hair and nails,
I need to watch this lets play when my dog isn't present as he went absolutely nuts at the meows 😂,
"""Just screams in my face, it means something!""
Means ""Feed me human""",
I remember cat dog turkey bird!  ☺️  Such fond memories.,
"You didn't see the ""Stop"" when the robot was playing the songs?",
Show me your cat I must see the cat I have 4 cats and cats one of them also chirps at birds,
If the cay dies in the end I will be very very very very angry,
Nothin like sittin down with a snack and watching jack fiddle with a playstation game.,
My heart skipped at least 2 beats what the poor cat stumbled.,
Through this whole thing I kept thinking about Netflix love death & robots episode of the three robots. Anyone else?,
"So apparently ""Oh biiig stretch"" is just some evolutionary response we've developed, because I've said that to every animal for as long as I can remember xD",
I love it when both you and Evelyn play the same game because I love how you guys react differently to the game or different choices you guys make! This game is no exception to that! 👍,
"""A natural light that leaked from a star and landed at our feet...""
Jack, that's sunlight.",
hi mother,
"The excitement in his eyes at 0:12 , is so precious .",
"I was wearing a cat shirt when I watched this.  Coincidence? I think not!

P.S:  I hope Jack sees this!",
Why does his forehead look big?,
"Dead city, also known as Mexico",
Took me 6hrs to finish the game,
The first 10 minutes of this game me total rainworld vibes,
"I just got here from the twins video and Mr. JSE forgot the third most important portion of the group. There's Sean. There's Jack.

But where's Juhsean, Master of Card Games.",
"Jack, I don't know where your mind goes when you think cat game. But mine definitely doesn't go to this game will look bac",
"This is such a creative game my aunts cat passed away and was around my childhood for 16 years, miss you Aimee❤️",
Jack! If you meow 100 times you get an achievement!,
The light that lands at our feet is the Sun,
That part in the beggining with jack talking about cats jumping is so accurate my cat waits a few minutes before jumping,
You should call the cat Septicat.,
Yes! I was hoping you’d play this!!! Make BB proud,
it infuriates me so much that he doesnt do what hes supposed to,
2:34 ive only known arlo for a day and a half but if anything happened to him i would kill everyon in this room and then myself. Rosa Diaz,
"*The Cats of Us*

Jack you are too much",
JACK PLEASEEEE DO MORE OF THIS GAME AND DO VIDEOS LIKE THIS WHERE THEY ARE LONG! I BEG OF YOUUU!!,
can i get some kind of warning if any animals d/e in this series cause my mental health needs it lol,
Casually watches this with 3 cats on me. Everything he said about cats is true. We're their pets,
I have not watched the video yet but I am so so glad this game is finally out! I've been following its progress for so long and have been so excited waiting for it. Super grateful to Sean too for playing since I don't have a play station :'),
You get an achievement when you go through all the TV channels,
Jack I need more of Until Dawn content!!!!,
I just got n notification form a twitch streamer says is cat game good,
The architecture and setting feels like Jak 2 and Destiny mixed together.,
"i need to know if you reunite with your little cat friends, that cutscene is heartbreaking and i need it to have a happy ending",
YAY CAT TIME,
My cat is very into this game as well🤣🤣🤣he keeps standing on his back legs and trying to touch the cat through the tv lol,
"Jack, we all know the cutest game is Slime Rancher.",
"I didn't realise how much I say ""Awh big stretch"" or anything similar to cats till I watched this and realised all cat parents are the same",
"hope your okay jack

😀",
heavily reminds me of love death and robots episode 1 from netflix where all of humanity has died off and only sentient robots and cats remain in the world,
21:25 this is the same man who said he was “smartly good in the brain hole” smh,
"Elliott was shivering, wasn't he? Maybe he's the cold robot. You'll be able to go back.",
What if now hear me out jack what if the scribble writing isn't another language  it's just in English but your a cat so it doesn't make sense,
"Jack: “Do you realize how much effort it takes as a human to do all this?”

Well, I mean…we COULD have adapted differently buuuut, you know. We strived for convenience instead and became increasingly lazy and less physically impressive. 🥲",
This cat looks exactly like Firestar and has his wits and curious nature... Coincidence? I think not Firestar will forever be doing something to get himself and possibly others killed,
"Loving this game already and I've never even heard of it until I saw your upload. Also, going to go play FF7.",
I feel like jack would love the game tunic,
"I can't wait for this to be animated😌
Catsepticeye",
I need a 22 hour livestream of this game,
Like how he has literally walked on and jumped at multiple times for that last battery.,
"Entertaining series so far. Very excited for the next ones, but please take care of yourself Jack. If you need to take a break with your back, or mental health, we understand :)",
@Jacksepticeye this game reminds me of love hate and robots. There's one of the episodes where all humans have died and cats and robots have taken over. But cats can speak English now,
"24:10 This is literally how I feel about this game. I didn't know I needed it, but I need it.",
jack talking to everyone vs him passing by the person cleaning the paint without trying to say hi constantly,
"Imagine at the beginning when Sean was talking about understanding his cat, we just got a little compilation of BB screaming and Sean crying.",
i bought the game and beat it in 5hr. couldn't stop playing. it was so good.,
why is there so many ads,
The little robot that follows the cat around reminds me of the ghosts from Destiny game,
my cat loved watching you play this so much she blocked the tv 💔💔 and when i put it on my phone she kept smacking my phone smh,
"As a fellow cat lover (even though my dad’s the one with multiple cats), I share your sympathies, Jack, in that I hope nothing bad happens to the cat. 
Also I said “big stretch” about a half second before you did the first time.",
1:18:09 viben,
"Cat: *Exists* 
Sean: 🤩",
WHAT’S HAPPENED TO UNTIL DAWN. YOU GONNA FINISH IT???????,
I'm also playing the game but I'm also here to watch Jack explode from the sheer adorableness from this game,
"I need to play this game, it has a wonderful vibe and I hope that I can see more of this. This is incredible.",
YES,
"i asked last video, nobody saw my comment but he did an episode!!!!!",
I get STRONG soma vibes from this..especially from that capsule/robot body in the beginning,
this made my day,
"This is so cuteee, I'm cryinggg😭😭💖💖",
I am hugging my cat while watching this🥲,
104 degrees Fahrenheit thats warm we get that every day in Oklahoma in the summer,
Quite a few people said big stretch,
my first thought was Maze Runner,
"The cat in game reminds me of my cat, Fat Boy. (He is alive, very hyper.)",
Nathan Brake the Cat,
Everyones talking about the cat but not the little robot friend he has made ;-;,
Hey jack I was wondering if your ever going to play turbo dismount 😁,
this game makes me want to go and hug my three sweet babies right now. the cat that fell almost made me tear up.,
"Jack said chill beans and my infant son laughed, he loves Sean so much.",
And my first in video ad was one trying to sell me modern looking cattrees. Nice!,
just got it,
"i love jacks ""if anything happens to this cat im gonna kill everyone in the room and then myself"" lmao",
IM SO EXCITED,
"I got this game yesterday and got 100% this morning, all trophies (I’m on playstation)",
Little kitty big city will be coming out soon as well! ☺️,
This definitely should win game of the year,
More Until Dawn please!,
My cat sounds exactly like yours,
It’s the lion king all over again,
If this was made with dogs it would be 100000000 times better,
At 57:28 my first thought was Immediately “MARTY WE HAVE TO GO BACK TO 1989”,
"This is, by far, the best emotionally charged let's play I've ever seen Sean do.  Whoever the developer of this title is, owes this man some royalties because as soon as I get home I'm buying this game because of this video.",
Watching Sean while on vacation in Ireland 💪🏼💪🏼😎,
That unfortunate moment when I want to play this for myself so badly and now I'm going to deprive myself of the joy that is Sean's playthrough until I do 😭,
My cat has been screaming and having the zoomies for the last couple hours and now thta he has finally calmed down its time to watch this with him,
"I have been waiting for this game! I'm so glad you're playing it, Jack!",
The Scorpion reference 👍🏼,
My fiance got this game just for me. I have something to do on the weekends now. Sorry job. This game is more important lol xD,
"Jackie boy , quick question are you gone finish until dawn?",
HAVEN'T EVEN WATCHED YET BUT I AM BEYOND HYPED I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THIS GAME FOREVVERRR <333,
The zurks look like ticks! In love with this game!!,
I'm going to be a new cat,
"Oh no, not the bucket again",
I don't like cats. Probably responsible for killing all the humans.,
When I saw the cat with the bucket I screamed bucket cat I also thought omfg its Stanly parable all over again,
"Could we get a translation of the our cat going ""Run you fools."" Before sliding down into the depths? Wait, their not gray, but could still be called Gandalf.",
This is likethe real life version of Ratchet and clank XD a cat like creature in a world of mo tears that carries a sometimes flying robot that also gets carried in his back,
A lets play? nice,
Why would I play this game if I can watch someone play it.,
I think this game takes place in the world of   Nier Automata,
is THAT thah MOOOOOOOOOOON?!??!,
I got an ad for this game on this video,
His face when the kittie fell looked like he wanted to cry don’t worry I wanted to cry too,
This game is so cool and cute! But are you going to continue your 2nd play through of until dawn?,
"Anyone else see, “Quantum Tunneling, A Boring Book”? 😆",
B-12 sounds like E. Gadd and im in love,
WHERE is until dawn....,
Gonna guess that Sean has Trophy notifications disabled. I remember they stopped popping up during his Miles Morales playthrough.,
"If you notice here at the passage about space at 1:30 , the Sun has consumed Mercury since it said the Earth is the 3rd planet from the Sun. So cool. I’m so glad you’re playing this game.",
We lost our kitten of a year old not long ago. I might get this just to remember him.,
just finished the game and its phenomenal as a whole,
1:08:59,
This is hilarious!! We have a small black cat named Kevin and my toddler kept saying “Kevin!!” 🤣,
pffff... wake me up when Stray: Doge edition comes up.,
"It always cracks me up how people are like “ew, cats” and then they get a cat and fall in love with them. If you give a cat a lot of attention and love, especially when they’re little, they grow up to be very affectionate and sweet.",
"3:13 
I think its law to say ""Big Stretch"" to any animals that stretch. haha",
play it with mimi,
"I thinking maybe B12 was the science uploaded himself into the computer and miss remembering stuff
interesting idea",
Oh my god i screamed when the cat fell NUOOOO ORANGEEEEE,
I think the language in this game is a made up language that in the game the cats can understand what they're saying,
B12 looks like morph from treasure planet and i can't 🥺🥺🥺,
BB in the background hearing Sean play the game: father why must you belittle me,
I would love to watch this but the camera spinning around the cat to look at everything every second is making me so dizzy 😵‍💫,
jAcK wheer is ur controller,
This reminds me of a game called shelter with the badgers.,
"Jack, you can get through it in three 75 ish minute episodes",
Jack if you dont upload the rest of until dawn I will implode my existence,
"The cats were meowing to one another so this can't have been created by people with cats as, even for someone who doesn't know an awful lot about cats and isn't a cat person at all, I know they don't meow to one another, and I'm guessing if people don't exist anymore in this game and the cats have been people-less for a decent amount of time, they've lost their reason to meow in the first place because cats only meow at us. And that environment you start in looks stunning. Nature taking her rightful place again on the planet.

I love whenever ""don't mind if I yes"" happens.

I thought this would be like Shelter but this is so much more. Wow!

19:45 Are those things supposed to be like giant ticks? Because, gross.

I thought that looked like hangul too.

""I'm a cat, not a natural disaster."" I would say cats are natural disasters. That may have been a bit harsh, sorry.",
Wait why would a cat need a flashlight. Can‘t they like see in the dark? 😂,
I love how cameras do a little nod when u meow at them,
"if you pause at 30:57 and look at the carpet..it kinda reminds me of BMO, well one of the BMO'S. Idk what i'm looking at but oh well lol.",
"I want to name the cat Skrinkly. Idk why, I just feel it fits",
We got egg sized hail here yesterday. Nature be all over the place everywhere.,
i love game its very cute and the story is so good already can't wait for more,
I guess Elliot is just going to stay cold.,
Wheres until dawn? 😢,
"Jack: you guys at home will remember if I did
Me, pouring myself another drink: remember if you did what?",
i am not ready for the cuteness overload oh my gosh,
More jack please this is so cute I want more,
"The music and ambience at 43:25 reminds me of Half Life, specifically the Orange Box Half Life 2 screen",
At Exactly 1:21:47 we see Jack become a true cat and request a door opened only to then not enter it.,
"Congrats for #1 on Gaming Trending

Just Purr-fect for someone of your caliber.",
"""The Cats of Us.""

Aaaand we're OFF, ladies and gentlemen! 😂🤣",
This was beautiful game play,
Bitches really gonna watch a 2hr video about a cat. It's me. I'm bitches.,
"Sean, I know comments aren’t something you can filter through as easily anymore but I wanted to say that Catto and Fugue in G Minor was a SOLID joke and I appreciated it",
We’re is until dawn jack,
This game is Purrfect. 😂🐱💁🏻,
I miss my cat,
"""Gotta sharpen those nails!""

They're called claws Jack, not nails 😒

40° C= 104° F for those who didnt know.",
"I started playing this game with my cat, since she always has to be in my lap when I'm playing games... She's really good at slamming her paw onto the space bar at the wrong time and almost getting us killed",
It’s so jack to forget that he gave music page five to the musician already,
"I saw my dad play this also and it was cute,god it’s so adorable",
Hey Jack if you love games with beautiful backgrounds you should check out the game Lost Ember. It is one of my favorites.,
YESSS I'VE BEEN WAITING <3,
"Jack: *gives a music sheet to the robot musician* 
Also Jack: I am missing 4 music sheets 
Me: you mean 3 Jack you legit gave the robot musician one already not even a minute ago",
"Jack I have one question that i’m sure you probably answered already, but is bb’s name a metal gear reference?",
46:31 it's gotta be sunlight,
Is it just the YouTube compression or do the frames feel a bit cranked some times? Animations are a bit fast.,
i hate cats ...,
i just completed the game im not going to give spoilers but what i will say the game gets so cool! i cant wait to see other videos from you,
"Game:  ""Something something safe behind a stack of books.""
Jack, much much later:  ""Oh, this safe has been here in the library this whole time!""",
"Nope... I want to watch this, but I have to play it before I watch it. Can't wait to watch this later tho. 🥰",
DID IT COME OUT!?!?!!!,
"1:22:31 
6.9 million years devs I see what you’re doing",
This game is gorgeous ❤️,
who else waiting for ep 3 of until dawn,
Currently with me ooold cat lovin life,
Come on man. The light from the stars was sunlight. Its talking about sunlight and how it helped humans grow. Like 🤦,
"They knew exactly how to get us cat owners to cry and freak out when the little Stray fell over the side, my god. My heart nearly stopped!",
cant wait for ep 2!!!,
The ancient light that leaked from a star and helped things to grow = Sunlight Sean,
DAMNIT I knew you’d cover this game too I’ve been trying to post my first video for hours,
jack! you need to make a letsplay on terraria it would be so awesome.,
"NO WAY YOU PLAYED THIS, I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR A GAMEPLAY",
"S0b please Sean, you found all the music sheets.. Its on the wall,, you gave it to the musician- He Has It...",
Is this game on steam?-,
Stray (the better cyberpunk),
Has anyone ever noticed that Jack sounds like the bird from Aladdin?,
"Natural light that leaked from a star to land at our feet is likely just a fancy way of saying ""The sun"" I'd imagine. The sun used to warm and nourish the robots ancestors.",
Jack referencing Rosa from Brooklyn 99 is just what I didn’t know I needed today.,
Reminds me of Maze Runner,
my cat never cared about videos but you should know that he saw the cat and watched this whole thing with me,
2:29 major foreshadowing?,
Can we acknowledge the fact that jacks cat sound was pretty accurate,
I love this game much and I believe you missed one of the most classic references,
"6:25 Lol, it has happened! Its called Love, Death + Robots. (S3 Ep1)",
I love jacks content because it's so random but relevant and i just love watching these play through's it makes my day,
"The sheer amount of environmental detail in this game is blowing my mind, I've never seen a game with such an amazing attention to detail before",
If you Meow 100 times in the game you get a cute lil achievement,
7:18 “Move”,
this is already my new favorite game. As soon as the next paycheck hits imma get this game.,
omg the guy passed out at the bar was dressed up like Marty McFly from the year 2015!!! With the orange jacket and florescent hat!,
"8:53 ""Fly you fools""",
Jack where is the rest of until dawn?,
"Very accurate aminations, I too allowed a cat to live in my house (you never ""own"" a cat)",
"I really think the poncho was for Elliot, the robot was shivering.",
69k likes  nice,
"I think you had to give that poncho to Eliot, he was shivering as if he was cold. Not like you could actually do anything about it now.",
why does B-12 sound like Professor E-Gadd? Suspicious.,
Yoo jack I have been watching your channel since your happy wheels videos,
ahhhhh yes i was so hoping he'd play this! it looks so good : ),
Sean's reaction to the cat falling at the start of the game was extremely identical to mine. My eyes actually filled up with tears when it happened on my playthrough. ;-;,
"Literally cuddled up with my two kittens right now, watching this. It’s magnificent 😍😍",
"Yeah man, here in the Netherlands it's about 40 degrees too",
"@14:54 ""What is going through their heads? Head empty?"" 
Then proceeds to Cat perfectly against paint cans",
"Hey Séan, I'm trying to be a youtuber myself. If I had the time I would consider playing this but how do you handle when there are multiple games you want to play? Is playing the game just after release a better or will people watch regardless?",
I’m out of town and this makes me miss my cat goose,
Kitty do no wrong kitty only orange only do orange cat things,
"""You can never catch a cat! Their to quick!""
**Half a second later**
""AH- YOU CAUGHT ME""

(19:24)",
This video was very delightful to watch.,
I've been waiting for this game to get out there cause I havent been able to play it myself but it looked SOOO good,
B-12 talking reminds me of luigi's mansion 3,
"46:12, that's definitely the Sun",
Adorable and interesting story. Cant wait for part 2,
wish i could play this myself but its around 30 dollars and i need to save my money :') happy i have u tho jack so i can still see this game,
Aww  Jack is adorbs as a kitty 😻,
What about the rest of Until Dawn?? :(,
Now someone has a draw a cat jack (like green cat with a eyeball tag collar),
CATS I LOVE CATS I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THIS GAME BUT I HAD TO WALK AWAY FROM MY CKMPUTER BECAUSE I GOT TOO EXGITED CATS YOURR PLAYING A GAME WITH AFORABLE FUCKING CATS AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA,
I love all the Cat-scenes,
The ADHD was very apparent in this episode😂,
OMG I tagged you on TikTok awhile ago to do this game I’m so excited!,
"From what I heard, cats knock stuff over cause they cant see up close so they push stuff to see if it moves like a mouse or something.",
Don't worry Jack! Trust the process! That poncho will serve its purpose!,
"I hope that they come out with a dlc, that it focus on the other cats.",
"43:04 come to think of it, that specific cat, looks like Goose from Captain Marvel",
"This is great, but honestly I wish he would play ""Mavis Beacon Teaches Typing"". Why don't these big youtubers care about what we as fans truly want to see??",
PLEASE RE PLAY LIFE IS STRANGE,
WE FOUND JACKS WEAKNESS ITS CATS,
"I’ve been spending the last five minutes trying to make a pun for cat and coop
Cat-operation
Ca-optive",
Also its really cool getting to hear about Seán cat  a bit throughout the game. Because theirs some similarities that my cat licorice dose as well in terms of cat behavior,
Nice Brooklyn Nine Nine reference at 2:34,
I love one of my kitties as well. But instead of no sweet precious baby. She is more a public menace then anything.,
It was 43^C where I am in Texas yesterday. We’re basically asked to have almost no electricity running during the day outside of essentials to avoid rolling blackouts.,
"*Cats are evil masterminds, they know exactly what there doing when they knock that thing off your shelf onto ur head at 4:30 am on a work day. They all get together and go over a game plan at the beginning of each week. The dogs have told me so.* 

Haha",
Jesus died for you,
been playing this game and the sfx impresses me the most. Everything is so accurate!,
I literally cried at the beginning when he fell because he lost his friends,
Oh shit now I’m stuck between choosing to watch this or gabs,
This is the only game that made me cry within 10 minutes. That fall was too much,
I would LOVE if this could be the most liked video on his channel ♡,
Are you gonna make more of this? I wanna see the game finished with you and the cat finding the outside I can’t stand the thought of not getting to see you see him through to the end in a weird way,
"Jack: Isn't this kinda like the matrix when the robots took over but instead of the robots taking over the cats took over?

Me: oh now hes gone and done it...

edit: I feel like people aren't gonna get this joke so to explain Jack just described the terminator but said the matrix.",
"It's 40°C at Heathrow Airport, where there is no shade, everything is covered in black asphalt tarmac, and jet engines are spewing superheated air.
Most of England didn't break 35°C.

Airports also make up a large proportion of temperature data, so the numbers are greatly inflated across the board.
Don't believe the bullshit anthropogenic climate change narrative. Believing that humanity has enough impact on the environment to make a meaningful change in the overall climate is just pure fucking hubris.
Stick to gaming and wisecracking, Sean.",
the mic picked up the purring from the controller purrfectly,
i love how the other cats wait for you when you get left behind,
No spoilers but there is a Skyrim reference in the game. I thought it was a clever little touch.,
Bout to start a flame war by saying dogs are better,
i actually was thinking of getting this game and trying it out! think i most def will now :) also was wondering if u were going to continue to do ur second playthru of until dawn,
"Please do a full playthrough of this! Funny and adorable game, but very relaxing which is very needed right now.",
"Jack i highly suggest a game called ‘brothers: a tale of two sons’. The art is beautiful. Its quite old (not OLD old) but it totally gets away with it. 
You control both characters on one controller- you can play it yourself or with someone else. 
Idk if you already played it but its an hour long maybe? I think you would enjoy it, much love <33",
"Im so glad everyone is playing this! I can’t play it which is upsetting, but I’m very glad I get to watch jack play it!",
This is unrealistic...Ginger cats are lazy.,
"How are you dealing with asthma, While you have a cat, the fur is really bad",
"Cats don't meow to each other. Do they?

Just like Jack, I don't want to see the cat get hurt either. Probably won't watch anymore just because of that. Especially being a cat mom with two kitties already.. My Houdini wouldn't want to survive as well, he's too docile and cautious. But the cautious manner would keep him surviving longer though. My other kitty, Dusty might be another story.",
dej ashahz aro ahziss,
Assassin cat,
"Don't worry Jack! You will still go back to the slums after the next chapter. You still need that sweater, it'll come in handy soon! Love the content, and there's so much of this gem to enjoy!",
"1:22:34 that many days is 6,967,489.5 years meaning if the first computers were in the 40s were set in the year 6,969,432 which makes me think the developers tried to make a funny number joke and that is just commendable

Edit I might be wrong but researching computer history a bit more you could technically say the ideas of how computers worked were a bit earlier making the year actually 6,969,420",
bruh the scene where the cat is holding on for dear life then falls it tugs at my heart strings so hard i felt like my heart was gonna stain the wall!,
"Jack: “there’s too much to do and it’s frying my brain.”

Proceeds to do the main quest before even talking to Momo and get almost all of the notebooks beforehand.",
cat,
This is just Jack descending in catness,
"I'm getting major ""love, death and robots"" vibes from this game and I love it",
I cant wait until I'm able to play this! Idc about spoilers.,
"2:37 So, essentially it is The Cats of us part ii",
"I have only known this cat for a few hours but if anything happens to it,i will kill everyone and then myself",
Sean you should play subnautica again as I want to see you reunite with Sally and pepper,
When I die I want to come back as a post apocalyptic cat,
I’m sorry but I’ve been waiting for until dawn part 3?,
"""Oh, biiig stretch"" literally me anytime my cat stretches",
Hay Seán I just want to let you know that a have 2 cats that are pregnant and they are sitting on my lap watching the video their names are Cali and Grace also please give me some baby kitten names ty love the video,
Looks like you live in one of those abandoned cities you see on mysteries of the abandoned on the Discovery channel or life after people that was on the history channel,
I’ll take a page from Felix can we put the cat in the bucket 🪣,
When i try to pull out the bar with all the tutorial it does not work,
BROOOOOO ON THE CALENDAR IT SAID OCTOBER 11 THAT'S MY B-DAY,
Jack you'll be happy to know that the creators of the game do love cats. Much like how Detroit become human was animated by actors doing the motions in a studio this game was made the same but with cats instead of people,
Jack is was on page looking for a new until dawn episode but I this will do,
The little glass window rooftop in the Dead City after the paint cans reminds me so much of The Aristocats.,
Jack just go trough the window again to give the poncho to Eliot.,
"Don't know about you guys, but little kitty looks a bit like an Oliver from the Disney movie. Can't wait to see next episode, Jack!",
men who like cats >>>>>>>>>>>,
Sentient for nearly 7 million years and counting.,
Jack's channel starting to become a gaming channel slowly and steadily,
Don’t worry the poncho comes in use later! You’ll be able to go back to the slums again! You didn’t miss anything jack,
Snuggling with one of my cats while watching <3,
"Sean mentioning about the start of Up being sad
Oliver and Company... I cannot watch that movie because the intro makes me cry all the frigging time, and it's a ginger like the character in this!",
I really hope ur not done with until dawn,
SOMEONE PLS MAKE A 'HEHEHEHE' COMPILATION ToT,
"This game is magnificent, I love how the greenery complements and covers the man-made structures, it's the perfect blend",
"I just got the game yesterday, and finished it today, its such an amazing and cute story, Im gonna play it over and over till I get sick of it",
"jack, can you call the little robot ""Bit""? it feels like a good name for the tiny friend",
Congrats on #1 on trending!,
My cat's birthday is today and watching the cat fall in the beginning was heartwrenching to think about that happening to my birthday girl,
My cat of 11 years passed away a couple days ago and this was a little hard to watch but Sean always brightens my day :),
i think that humans made robots and then the robots took over after destroying mankind. After that. there got to a point that the robots couldn't repair themselves and now the animals are left to survive,
Loved the Rosa Diaz quote!,
It's Elliot!!! He's the cold robot that needs the poncho!!!! He was shivering when you were talking to him.,
"...what is it about having a pet that just inspires humans to say 'biiiig stretch' every time they do it? it's weird, but cute.",
I literally cried when the cat fell off the ledge😭😭,
This would be a perfect game for the switch,
funny cat game,
Oh Seán is not going to like the ending of the game. 🙃,
"When the gaurdian said ""You're no Zurk, we are not familiar with your species, you're allowed in this village as long as you don't eat anyone."" all I could think of was Goose from Captain Marvel. The Orange Flerken.",
"At last, with humans extinct, cats get to be silly little guys in peace",
"The light leaked is refering to the sun. So the sunlight can't reach the surface anymore, that is perhaps why the humans died out. Now only robots and cats apperantly can live on the planet",
I freaking knew that Jack was going to play this game I have been waiting so long I saw this all over Facebook and I was like oh my God I know for a fact Jack was going to play this and I'm so excited for this series I have seven cats so I can relate to this!,
finished the game a minute ago I am so touched by this game,
I like how Jack just forgot that the cat literally came from outside,
Bro i just commented yesterday asking if you can play this game and woke up to this wow thank youuuuuu,
@5:38 “I am ready to slaughter!” *Mehp*,
i love this game sm,
Can you play tabs,
Im so ready for this playthrough,
Fun fact the cat this game is based on is called Murtaugh,
1:10 why did i expect voice lines from the cats,
"First time wanting to want to watch this game, only cause you Sean are fun to watch. (even if I’ve cussed at you a few times in the video >_>) :)",
I'm worried this is gonna have a sad ending😭,
Please tell me that catnip is either health or a save point. 🤣,
If you liked this then i think you'll like a puzzle game called milo and the magpies 😄,
It'd be a neat detail if the reason we can read the language written on things is because obviously the cat can't read. But some things are in English so that's not the case. Just saying it'd be neat if it were true. I like to believe the cat isn't actually smart and that it just has a massive amount of luck and the random cat things is doing is unintentionally helping it progress.,
"I’m not sure about this; but, it seemed like Elliot at 1:23:54 was shivering. Maybe the poncho is for him. 🤷🏻",
I got an ad for the game Stray while watching this. Coincidence?,
I literally just finished the hole game befor watching jack and though its a short game it I was so emotionally hooked I couldn't stop playing 🤣 💜,
"@jacksepticeye - cats cant see within 1 inch of their faces. They rely on whiskers and touch after that for their prey. I researched this and was actually astounded. Cats are amazing animals. The amount of information the take in and process as strays and household cats is amazing! Honestly, Egyptians worshipped them for their cleverness and hunting ability. you should do a video about them and their history. They actually bred themselves into taking advantage of human emotions of loving cute soft fuzzy things.....to get what they want....lol.",
This is an awsome game jack,
"my immediate thought when i saw the thumbnails of the cat was of Dexstarr, and that the game was gonna be something involving him and his journey as a member of the red lantern ring core",
"i've been wanting this game since i read the warrior cats novels circa whenever i read the warrior cats novels c.e.

unfortunately, the most modern console i own is a nintendo switch, followed by an xbox 360",
3:12 it's so clear that he says it whenever his cat stretches,
Watching you try to find the last battery was so hilarious,
This reminds me of this animal game on PS3 which let you choose various animals and you'd have to survive for a s long as possible while progressing through the ruined city. It was difficult but fun.,
Jacks Little laugh every time the cat did something cute was amazing,
Zurks sound like goat rabbits. Tiny creatures that eat anything and breed way too quickly XD,
1st on trending? Good job jack,
I was having a bad day then my cousin came in with a little kitty that was visiting and I was watching this too! such a coincidence!! I enjoyed this a lot,
I NEED MOOOOOOOOORREE! ✨✨✨ This is so awesome I love this game and watching Jack play it makes it even better!,
"Soo... What happened to Until Dawn? I cant be the only one thinking this...


Also... Please play CODE VEIN 😎",
When you playing until dawn I love that series,
"I just watched an ad on this video for the game that you are currently playing that's absolutely amazing

Edit: every time the cat meows in the video of my two little boys (who are cats) look at the TV",
Jack forgetting about the sun when translating the wall text in the slums is just the absolute best 🤣,
"WAIT I just figured out the ""outside"" the robots kept on calling it was actually at the start of the game with other four cats",
please watch the behind the scenes they posted because it shows cats in dot suits and record their movements to make it accurate! very cool tech i think you'd love to watch,

"Plz jack ,we need part 2 make it as soon as possible .",
Watching this next to my brothers cat lol,
"I'm fairly certain the group of cats are littermates. Basically what it sounds like; siblings from the same litter. They play and bond just like the ones you get separated from, which is why it can be beneficial to adopt a pair from the same litter so they always have each other in a new place. However the same can be said if they get separated and isolated; they get sad and lonely (hence why owners need to give them extra attention to fix that). So the goal to get the kitty back with his/her pals makes sense, as a littermate will likely go out of their way to get reunited if they are bonded well enough.",
The language in the game is standard galactic language also known as enchantment table language,
"""The ancient stories speak of natural light that leaked from a star and landed on our feet.""
Jack: natural light that leaked from a star and landed on our feet...did that relate to infection or something?..land on an asteroid or meteor?....
Me:....Ummm...I think it's talking about the SUN. XD",
Omori is pretty cute and today is the MC's birthday to boot.,
the andrew garfield laugh everytime,
"Hey look, it's jacks next try not to get anxious video.",
I started watching Jack play this on my tv and immediately my cat was like cats where did they come from and was staring at the tv and meowing and making other noises,
idk if this has already been said but the robots sound like the villagers from animal crossing,
"Just finished playing, I missed several memories so I will be replaying. Absolutely beautiful. I have 7 cats of my own and this game hit close to home.",
YESSSSSS! i saw the trailer for this like 2 years ago or something (don't quote me on that) and I've been excited for it ever sinceeeeee!!! its so pretty 🥺🥺,
Glad that he acknowledges the fact that cats do not care for human life,
today i got the productive day trophy        you have to let  the cat sleep for 1 hour,
"Tip for the further play through: The trick is to systematically search the little 'towns' that you come across. First the bottom floors, then the rooftops. That way you find everything related to the side quests.🙂

Tip 2: Don't worry about progressing things beyond the point of not being able to finish side quests, NPC's will clearly ask you if you finished everything in an area, once you are close to exiting.",
"Gab; holds it in.
Jack; DEVASTATED.

b12 sounds like dr Egadd from luigi's mantion,
When you read the letter I hope this will work I think the scientist tried uploading his mind to the robot and it failed. 36:05 nearly cried,
I just saw a clip of this game the other day and wanted to see more but couldn’t find it. Thank you jack you’ve brought it to me lol.,
"I asked you to play this game yesterday and you did ,don’t know if it had a connection or what but this game is so fun",
Love it!!!,
I just finished this game well my friend I have played it yet but I will be I can’t wait 🥰,
"Jack hasn't played Ghost of Tsushima right? I think he would love that game, I am currently playing it the visuals and the gameplay are stunning",
"i thought the game was going to bad at first due to having a file size of only 6gb, but its been great so far",
8:55,
This game looks interesting 🤨. Side note did Sean stop replaying until dawn? Lol,
OMG THIS GAMES WAS RELEASED???? I HAVE IT ON MY WISHLIST FROM WHEN U SAW A TEASER FOR IT ON TIKTOK,
46:30 I think they were talking about Fire,
One of my cats was absolutely captivated watching this video,
"I love this comment section from what I've read. All it is, is something happened that made me smile, giggle, or giddy.",
w vid,
"Where you began with the cats was the outside, so it's livable out there.",
"I've been waiting for Jack to play this. I was watching some other playthrough, and thought Jack would love the cat with a bag on its head",
Cried so bad when the cat fell into the sewer :(,
This is a scam i need more content,
yep 8:40 is where i stop..,
"8:57 It’s at this point where my heart just broke, my cat is very similar to the one you play as in this game and when I was playing this my heart just split in two. I actually started crying it was so heartbreaking",

"As someone who has to take B-12 vitamins, I can tell you they help with energy metabolism to fight against energy deficiency. Basically, creates energy so I'm not tired all the time",
"Sean, do you not know that Suns are stars? I need to know lol",
"Been waiting ages for this game. Hopefully I'll get a chance to play it. But yeah, I've been feeling pretty miserable. Having a break from my relationship as its just in a constant argument stage, stomachs causing me issues, mum's been diagnosed with crohns, and the doctors are concerned about me having it and I'm only 24... been feeling very low and unstable, but watching this, and then looking at my fur babies, yeah, two out of 3 of mine wouldn't survive this. My little girl would have a chance though",
turns out Daft Punk and Dead Maus are not cat people,
I'm so going to watch his gameplay but also evellyn (sorry if I spelled her name wrong!) 😭❤❤  they are amazing cat parents ❤❤ love when we get a BB cam on her streams 😭❤,
I’m so ready for the game theory videos on this game,
"Jack please play ""Best Month Ever""",
10 seconds in: is that THE MOOOOOON?!,
8:54 long live the king,
"AHHH how exciting!! This game came out of absolute nowhere for me, knew nothing about it and never heard of it until like yesterday when I randomly scrolled past clips of it on twitter. It looks so cool.",
YES I WAS HOPING YOU'D PLAY IT.,
I swear everytime the cat falls of something I just get a heart attack,
"So, I'm not gonna watch this because I want to experience the game for myself. But it's pretty cool to see you're playing it",
"Jack"" I got a light""
Me but he's a cat 😏 🤣😂",
"Had to skip through this video to make sure you hadn't gotten a far as me and I don't spoil the story, and ironically we stopped at the same part. Great game so far amazing development!",
This is so pretty I already enjoying this series and I can’t wait to see more as we go,
"40 C is a record in England?
I used to live in Switzerland where it's the highest temperature is 41.5 C... It sucks but is well survivable.",
It's heeeerrrrreeeee,
"the sound the cat made when he fell hurt me emotionally, i don't like it did that to us.",
I love cats soooo much but I’m allergic so I can’t touch them without getting rashes and puffy eyes witch is so sad to me because I love cats so much,
people complained on twitter it was to expensive i just wish it was full price,
"I watched Gab Smolders play this and loved it. Now I'm excited to see Jack's playthrough! Go Jack, go! :D",
This is making me what to Watch your last garden play through,
Jack saw the bandwagon and had to jump on it.,
"in the first five mins he was like....."" GOD IF ANYTHING FKN TOUCHES THIS DAMN CAT, I WILL ANIHALAITE ME AND MY SELF""   the cats are rlly cute tho",
"As soon as I started watching this my cat immediately came and sat down with me. 
This game is magic.",
I love a good brooklyn 99 reference ☺️,
"reminds me or love death and robots from netflix 
and one of the paintings i saw on the wall while you where playing was of the orange robot from the short video with the talking cats",
"This game just progressively gets better and it makes you attached to goddamn robots. Can't wait till Jack reach sewers, aka the heart of all those little things...",
"Ok, like, imma come back to watch this, but for now, I am off to go play it. I didn’t know this was out yet",
"Jack: [accidentally passes an opportunity to interact with another cat]
Me: [screaming in utter despair] NOOOOOOO GO BACK THE BABY",
thumbnail looks familiar,
"I can't wait until he gets to /that/ part. If you've played the game, you know what part. Why they put something like that in a game this cute...",
Sean needs to chill he gonna turn into a furry 🤮,
"Jack I hate that me and you started saying ""ddddddddddddd"" at the same time XD",
Did he give th cabels to the grandma? I cant remember,
9:03 “Long live the king.”,
Watching the beginning right now during a thunderstorm after playing the game myself xD,
"Sean trying to find the last battery: its probably staring me in the face
Me at home: yes it is staring you in the face",
The sad truth that this game is too high end for switch 😔,
40:36,
My dad just made a few videos on this game and I'm really excited to play it,
"The perfect game doesn't exi
YOU CAN PLAY AS A CAT",
The robot who plays the music is so amazing. I love giving him another song then resting by him and just vibing,
best game ever made f cyberpunk i want catpunk2077,
Is it on Xbox?? 🥹,
"Vitamin B12 helps make the brain work more gooderer and keeps your DNA unscrambled, among other things.",
"Bro Stop, the thing is I can handle people dying but if an animal dies then I will start sobbing",
My heart literally broke at the other cats watching him fall and meowing after him :(((,
"Jack: “Grandma grandma im coming”
Also Jack: oOo what’s this",
Can you get your kitty to watch the game and see what he does?,
I love Jack’s delighted chuckle at his cat’s meow making the other cats meow 🤣🥺,
"omg i didn't know it came out yet, time to go beg for this game!!!",
So glad jacks collecting everything,
"This game is already perfection as is, especially with the kitty dynamics and behaviors, but a cat customizer would be kinda cool ngl",
"Sean, take the poncho to Elliott",
"I was praying to great jebus that you'd play this, and I have been heard.",
Wait... Is 2:35 a B99 reference?????,
where did he find the other notebooks? I wasn't even aware that he was collecting them until he got momo's.,
"STFU about global warming.  This happens every 3000ish years.  The earth has a natural way to handle global warming, we should talk about solutions to the natural problem instead.  What will happen is 80% of ocean life dies as the ocean becomes more acidic.  All the dead carbon based life sinks and becomes deposited to form new oil reserves.  This is simply the first time humanity has been around to see the cycle happen.",
1:30 in and already I love it had cats before I can even remember lost afew unfortunately but that’s life hope this gam e lives up 2 what I think it could be,
"25:50
'If the game allows me to have this then I'm going to take it.' (proceeds to take)
Game : *no*",
"Hooray!
The cute looking cat game!
😽🥰",
I love cats!,
I am so glad you're playing this there's other lets players that's playing this but they're not taking the time to actually get the story or read the actual content and for that I really do thank you,
I want to play this game so much. I can't wait to watch you play it Jack. Hopefully with a big bowl of popcorn later tonight. 🍿 😋,
"people are already doing speedruns of this, why do that when you can just enjoy CAT",
Jack it will be cool if you played not for broadcast but the full game this time.,
you can see the actual pain in his heart at the beginning of the video,
"The first game in quite a while that seems fun to play without the need for guns, blood, and explosions.",
"3 minutes in and already got all i needed out of this: ""OOOOOO Big stretch!!""",
Okay my cat does that all the time. She sits there for 5 minutes deciding if she can make it or not before she jumps. LOL very accurate.,
imagine they create a game where you're a lion and you have to hunt to survive and do things in the wild become the king or something,
"I never thought there’d be a time where I’d watch Jack play as a cat, and enjoy it so much",
"In honor of Trico, we should name the player cat Turkey",
MORE PLZ,
Yay!!! Been waiting for this!,
Both my childhood cats passed in 2021. I couldn't watch it past the little baby falling and limping. I'm sorry,
"At 36:30 you get a flashlight, but that doesn’t make any sense! Cats can see in the dark, why would we need a flashlight? Ugh, tiny brain is so confused!",
I dont know if i can continue to watch this the part where the cat fell has me actually in tears,
My cat lily would probably scratch at the dead robots for food because she wouldn’t be able to survive in the wild oml 🤧,
Too bad Jim carrey retired I would love to see Jack do a comedy movie with him,
"The ""sky"" i believe is a dome 47:50... the stars are in a circle.",
"54:48
well done sean you now have also become a cat in soul.",
"Bibi is screaming ""Jack! Love me!!! Give me salami!!! Comfort me""",
Please Go back Goat simulator Videos 🥲,
Sean's Vidios Are Awesome,
I will kill whoever thought that this was a good idea 8:40,
I played this entire game today took about 6 hours I really enjoyed it,
Your cat is named Bebe???? MY CAT IS NAMED BEBE!!!! It's like...we are one in the same. Or...maybe they are one in the same??? 🤯🤯,
No more until dawn?,
"Jack: You can't catch a cat.

Also Jack: *gets caught*

Also Jack again: Ah!! I got caught!!

I died lol! 😂😂😂",
"The intro is like a nature documentary! You fall in love with an animal after seeing it for like five minutes, and as SOON as it gets in mortal peril, you freak out as you can't do anything but watch! Couldn't help but think of that meme from awhile ago.",
This is the video for a BB cameo!,
YESSSSS! IM SO GLAD HES PLAYING THIS!,
"Jack talking about it being a post apocalyptic world with cats reminded me of a show: 

There’s a show Love, Death, and Robots on Netflix and one episode shows the world after humanity died out and robots are trying to figure out what happened. They decide humans were stupid but they also saw one rocket making it all the way out of earth and thought that maybe there’s hope for humans after all. 

Then it jumps to a space colony with a guy in a spacesuit. The guy turns around and takes off his helmet to show he is not a person, but a cat. The joke I remember was “Who did you expect? Elon Musk.”

So they had a similar idea of how cats will surpass us in every way and I found that funny.",
"My cats chitter at me sometimes, and when i chitter back they chitter louder",
Cuteness overload 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺,
"Oh, to be a cat in a post apocalyptic cityscape. It’s all I want from life.",
This game I would say is a mix of cyber punk and solar punk. Not sure if thats the official name of the genre but its a very important part of sci-fi.,
"What language is that text? Nepalese? Vietnamese??

I thought it was going to be a linear 3D platformer. Pretty disappointed when it turned into a boring dialogue heavy open world RPG inventory puzzle item scavenging game like a cross between Cyberpunk 2077, Death Stranding, Undertale, Skyrim, Sunset Overdrive, Borderlands, Witcher 3, Watch Dogs 1, Anthem, Assassin's Creed 2, Dying Light 2, Titanfall 2, Destiny 2, Portal 2, Love, Death and Robots, and Monkey's Island, but boring like, well, like Death Stranding, Destiny 2 and Dying Light 2, really...",
finally i beated a game before jack did,
Holy cow the gaming world is so full of DORKS its insane,
When you looked at the tv and it was blurry that s something that happens to cats in real life they can't see anything closer than a foot in front of there face.,
Jacks videos always make my day. Thanks for everything that you do for us jack! We will always be grateful for you ❤️,
Seán is best cat dad,
Just bought the game myself and been really enjoying the exploration,
So did Jack drop the until dawn series or?,
This game is sooooooooo cute and adorable!!!!! I wants it so bad!!!!!,
That opening is sadder than the last of us opening.,
"I wanted to see a playthrough of this game the moment I saw the trailer, lo and behold,  here it is.",
Yes yes yes yes yes,
"the whole beginning had me the same there jack, i myself am a cat owner as well and it hurt to play this game man",
i just realized how to say ur name for anyone wondering its jack septic eye,
"Now...
*how does the boi taste?*",
Make this a series please 🥺,
Man it would be so cool to see you experience these games live,
"I adore this world! Cats? Robots? Funky bops? Heaven wrapped in a post-apocalyptic shell!
Also Jack occasionally responding to the cat noises with his own is just great.",
h3hee,
"At the bar, jack reads the thing about the employee of the month that takes place in XX27, well XX means 20 in Roman numerals so the guy was employee of the month in 2027",
sooo cuuuuute,
Zurks = Headcrabs and Snarks from Half-Life combined into one creature,
"32:43
""The cat doesn't even know what he's doing!"" 

The IRONY.",
"Yes, it is Midgar",
I heard one of the cats meow in the game and I looked around due to having cats and thought it was one of my kittens,
"I’d vote this for Game of the Year honestly. Elden Ring is a phenomenal game too, but there’s something so much more unique and nostalgic about this game. And the world itself, the atmosphere, the music, so good.",
"This game is so great, can't wait to see you play more",
I miss listening to Sean gush over reflections for 20 minutes,
Jack does like to mention his adhd doesn’t he.,
Lol I’ve been waiting for GLaSDOS to say “your specimen has been processed” when you where in the dead city lol secretly your in aperture science,
"""if anything happens to this cat, i kill everyone in this room and then myself""",
I'm a cat person I love cats so much and I love this game it's so cuteeee!🥺🥰,
Warrior cats 🐈,
"Jack, you have to play endling!",
"Game looks absolutely adorable but I don't think my anxiety could handle all the precarious jumps and falls I'd be like ""no baby I'm sorry!"" Just that opening part where the cats limping almost made me cry.",
The Meowening!,
I havent seen a game this beautiful and intricate that interested me this much since Alien: Isolation and Soma,
dude i was just on steam looking at this game and i come to youtube and jack has just posted a video playing damn it be like that,
IF THE CAT DOESN’T GET REUNITED WITH ITS LITTLE CAT FRIENDS I WILL SCREAM AND CRY I SWEAR TO GOD,
All I see is cat.,
"I had a cat that looked exactly like that, he loved to *big stretch* and he was really jealous of me because I was taking all the attention, he sadly died of cancer about 2 years ago, rip Bruce

Love this game, can’t wait for more!",
"I fuckin knew jack would play this LOL
It's such a game he would have on the channel.",
"Jack: I'm sorry I'm a cat I'm not really into Ball sports
Me: no that's more of a dog's job you're more into games that require a birdie",
"Oh no, Jack, cats don't just knock everything down. They knock your stuff down because that's not how they remember that place, and they don't like changes.",
The dead guy on theroof!,
RIP Until Dawn playthrough,
This is the wholesome content I needed,
"Death Stranding but instead of Norman Reedus you’re a cat, basically.",
"ten minutes in and i'm here sobbing over a fictional cat, this is promising",
This game is adoroble plus i have like 30 cats at home,
Bye 3:25,
It's 44° Celsius here in Vegas where I live 😭,
Me watching a cat game whilst stuffing my mouth full of goldfish,
"jack play fortnite agen PLZ wen you play I really enjoy it love you  pLZ play
 fortnite",
"May be game of the year, until the new god of war comes out than I'd like too see u compare the 2",
hrngghhhhh cat,
Don't worry Jack you can still give the poncho later since it's used for story line purposes,
"Awe!! I want to be reincarnated as a kitty cat 😻 I'm a cat lover myself and to be able to play as a cat!? Definitely going to try this game out!
Edit: Don't forget Jack, cats have 9 lives lol.",
"As a cat owner myself, this game warms my heart. It is so adorable and delightful! I love that robots are the next step in evolution for humans, being their ancestors the ""Soft Ones"". The environment of this game is amazing. The visuals are phenomenal and stunning. I adore this game! B-12 and the cat are so cute!",
"I saw FIVE SECONDS of gameplay from this video earlier and instantly impulse bought the game. I didn’t even watch the rest of it until just now because I’ve been playing it and exploring nonstop. This game honestly is a masterpiece. Also, a tip for later in the game: slow and steady wins the race! Speed isn’t key; preparation and patience are. There are definitely some “speed is key” moments though, but where most people would run through (and running is an option, not a requirement), carefully traverse the environment. I promise you, while it makes a slower playthrough, it makes an easier one for the first playthrough.",
2:35 i appreciate a good Brooklynn 99 reference cheers jack,
b-12 helps with iron deficiencies i believe,
Where is until dawn part 3 💖💕😭,
"Heaven & hell are the only 2 places you will go to for eternity:
Heaven is a place of everlasting peace, love, joy, & happiness.
Hell is a place of eternal punishment, torment, weeping, & gnashing of teeth!
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TO HELL!
But here's how you can obtain your salvation:
Do you know Jesus Christ?
A Believe in your heart that Jesus suffered a brutal crucifixion, died on the cross, & rose again on the 3rd day 
B Confess with your mouth that Jesus is lord & admit that your a sinner: Lord, have pity & mercy on me, a sinner!
C Get water baptized & build a personal relationship with the holy spirit 
D Turn from your wicked ways & sin no more 
E Worship God in spirit & in truth & go 100% all in for the kingdom of God 
F Lay everything down to go follow Jesus 
Get to know exactly who Jesus is & what he did in the new testament of the holy Bible!
All of heaven rejoices over 1 sinner who repents!

Salvation is free, but
Salvation costs everything!",
11:51,
"Jack complaining that he progressed the story when actively completing a main story objective. SMH that's videogame 101, complete all sidequest stuff you want to do BEFORE doing any main quest stuff. Never know when it'll progress you to the next section.",
"I want more games where you play as an animal.
Wouldn't it be fun to fight a war as a cat? Just go up to them and say ""I have judged you and found you lacking "" they'd burst into tears.",
At 1:08:00 if pause right there you will see a QR code scan it and see what you will get,
If you meow at a security camera they nod at you :>,
"My cat knocks various items off shelves, or swings my floor mirror back and forth, to get me to wake up in the mornings",
Wife and I started this game last night.  Freaking love it.,
The first bit with the overgrowth and tall walls really reminded me of Maze Runner and now I want a Maze Runner game with massive walls,
"Can't wait for the next video, I want to know if the cat finds his homies!",
It looks like the maze runner maze,
you're starting another series? what happened to until dawn?,
"*Seán* : *""it's probably staring me in the face and I just don't see it""*

*Me* : **been screaming at him for ten minutes about the battery that he's stared straight at several times** *""YES GOD JUST LOOK AT IT PLEASE""*

*Seán* : **finally finds it and makes up for it by following up immediately with cat jokes/puns**",
"Number 1 on gaming rn , good job dude ❤️",
1:10:43: Sparkus Aurelius,
Man I love this game so cute,
"I remember this game primarily because it was published (not made, PUBLISHED) by the same guys who published Outer Wilds. You know, that really great game that you said you liked but then completely forgot about?",
"Jack: Ah, gotta make a mess, do we?
Also Jack, not even 2 minutes later: I see no God up here but ME!",
I want to play this so bad but Amazon Germany wont dispatch my new PC >:(,
Every robot sounds like me whenever someone asks me why I never leave my home.,
CAAAAAATTTT 😍😍😍😍,
"23:20 not again, OOH SCARY! * turns into darth vader *",
THE LIL MAN,
i really need to get this game,
I think that the robots are human upload or something similar,
This is such a good game so far. I bought it yesterday and Played for hours lol the style with the cute cat is a perfect match.,
1:10:41 Unit designation R0D1N.,
Has jack ever played A Plagues Tale: Innocence cause that might be something he would play,
"Me enjoying this as 5 stray kittens wander under the house, poking around and munching the food I put out for them",
I'm glad Sean was as properly distraught as I was playing when the cat fell and was hurt. I think all of us can collectively agree that if anything happens to this cat we will lose our shit.,
I need more episodes of this.,
"I was surprised that the graphic card requirement for this game isn't even that high. Wow, great job devs",
28:37 ...problem?,
“Cats came long before us they will live way after us” AND THAT IS FACTS,
"1:22:28 

2544875556 days divided by how many days in a year, 365, is around 
7 million years.

Jesus Christ, that is quite a long while.",
Jack saying cats will outlive us makes me think of that Love Death & Robots,
"I supposed to be doing homework, but I end up getting distracted by cat videos",
Quickest intro yet.,
they look like massive ticks to me,
"My 8-9 week old kitten Oatmeal just passed away this morning, she was very sick and losing weight no matter what we did and eventually it came to an end. She got plenty of cuddles and love before she passed however so I'm just glad she's resting now. This video gave me comfort in this moment and my heart goes out to anyone else who has lost a pet recently, feline or not. 💙 Thank you Jack, you always seem to post when it's needed most.",
This video was a completely delight. I loved every second!,
46:17 he forgot what the sun was,
I knew that jack would play this game,
"Whenever Jack chuckled or laughed about the cat made my day so much brighter!
It made me absolutely crazy about this game when I played it how the cat was so cute!",
I just got this game last night.  And it so cool to play a game as a cat!  I wish there was more games like this.  Because you always play as a human. I want new experience.,
YESS waiting for you to play this sorta game i enjoy watching like beyond Detroit,
"""i'm a cat not a natural disaster""

When cat,
"I remember when they went down the pipe for the first time, I said that they were dead. Few minutes later the main cat falls down a hill or something like that. I was laughing at the fact I predicted that would happen",
"Michi con mochilita, that's all I need",
"Hi there Mr Sean! I'm so glad you're enjoying this amazing pear. You should give another try to Outer Wilds. It's from the same Publisher and touches a bit of the same themes. Also, you once began a series of it and never proceeded, maybe you could give it another go after this one",
I am very attached to cats (my cat being the reason since she had gotten me through a lot) so hearing the sad meows in the beginning actually almost made me cry,
nine minutes in and the tear ducts just let loose pLs,
"9:20 the last of us part 1, made this to us right on the beginning!🥲",
"life is pain
and kinda cool",
"10 minutes in, I was already crying. This game is so pretty but why would they do that to the cat 😭😭 His little meows",
It’s like that episode in love death and robots😂,
Hey jack why don't we go back to mad max maybe we can see a play through 👀,
I will watch until I am sure it’s going to end exactly how I think it’s going to end.,
I got an ad for stray while watching a vid on it. 🤣🤣,
"Whoever dislikes. Is pure  evil.

I put down stray cats for a living.,
"jack:and you can go to my show and get some coffee
me:*uninterested*
jack:and also hot cocoa and tea
me:SINCE WHEN!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!?!",
"I beat the game today, and it is my new favorite game! Good luck, Jack!",
I'm sad I finished the whole game launch day XD. I'm going to go back and 100% it,
"The fact that the main character cat looks E X A C T L Y like my own cat, whose name is Jack, btw, is giving me the biggest and bestest vibes. I hope nothing bad happens to them.",
"I came to see how good the programming/developing for the cat was,

And I ended up staying to watch the story unfold

I like it!",
Cutest video ever especially jacks reactions,

mr beast,
That intro 🔥🔥🔥,
Tell me you have a robot arm and amazing at production without telling me you have a robot arm and you are amazing at production challenge much?,
The intros keep getting crazier 😄😄,
Forget about the Mac focus on the wallpaper and compare to the map of algeria in north africa u ll be surprised theres no telescope or space just a fake propaganda,
Hard pass.,
starting of video was really awesome 🔥🔥,
Good wallapaper of the new James Webb telescope picture,
Holy shit that intro. I’m always surprised by your creativity man,
Love the Casey Shirt!,
5:07 or skratch the Sh*t out of it and dont care.,
What’s with the mask?,
I still love my m1 MacBook Air. Best Laptop I’ve ever gotten for $800.,
"Get a good cooling pad, save money.",
The same color issue is with iPhone 13 midnight as well..,
Can we all just take a minute to appreciate that spectacular intro?,
that intro transition...wow!,
How are you the only tech person I follow showing the laptop while others are saying this is coming later? 😳,
"1
2
3
4) give a shit on fingerprints, as it is a tool!",
"The notch is only invisible if using dark mode and default resolution. At max resolution, you see it. The notch is so stupid.
256GB is a ploy for the upgrade. Since inception. You should know that, MKBHD.",
the intro tho,
"It's anodised, that isn't paint chipping. This would be the oxide layer chipping away because they have sharp edges. At my current workplace (CNC machined aluminium hardware) we always chamfer sharp edges, especially around screw holes and such to prevent exactly this from happening.",
Or 4. Just dont give a crap about finger prints and minor scratches after a while of use :-D,
With a fucking notch,
Can I get a link to those wallpapers please?,
"Wow, it’s staggering the difference between the M2 Air and the M1 Max. 1h35m render vs 23 minutes.",
Give some credit to james  webb space  telescope for the wallpaper 😁😁,
Matte transparent skin should look dope on this one,
"But why only 256 gb on storage, nowadays smartphones  have 128 gb base line so in laptop 512 gb should the base line maybe up to 1 tera",
"WOW, that intro though. Amazing work.",
Love the @CaseyNeistat T-shirt ;),
The wedge shape was iconic. I will hold onto my Air forever! That moment when Steve took it out of an envelope was iconic! I have always wanted an air and I finally got one...the M1 Air after being a PC user for all my life.,
Nice Intro.. I am nitpicking.. you didnt mask out or remove the tape marker on the table for marques to place the laptop..,
"I am little bit annoyed from huss I can hear in your video and it is just not in different authors' videos. Please may you try to figure it out? It sounds like AC or something like that. Thank you, love your videos - I am with you for like 11 years now and had no complaints what so ever :-)",
review the Razer Kishi V2,
"Yeah 8gb of memory? My 2012 MacBook Pro came with that much base. It wasn’t enough then for a Pc then, and it’s still not now. 😂 my phone has more ram now",
I’m good with my 2012 MacBook Pro lol,
Have ordered mine - is there a skin for it?,
"What I wish more reviewers would look at is the price is other countries.

Lets take Germany for example where I live. Ok, our prices already include 19% of taxes but still the new base MacBook Air is 1499€(!), bump it up to what MKBHD got here it‘s 1849€ (!).

As the MBP has been around a while the 14“ rn starts around 1949€.

Why in the world should I even consider getting the new Air with prices like that? No idea what Apple was thinking but unless it‘s not at least 200-300€ cheaper no way. I rather get the M1 Air or if Windows is an option there‘s so many good ultrabooks around 1200€ which is still 300€ less than the crippled M2 Air.
I absolutely don‘t get these prices, they are not only not competitive in any means but doing the conversion I also feel massively ripped off by Apple in Europe.",
"Chooses a very specific color.
Also adds a dbrand skin.",
Nothing about Apple is deceivingly expensive. It’s pretty obvious their stuff is overpriced. Ha...,
"Geeeez $1400 for that is ridiculous. If anyone needs a MacBook, I got you at a discount",
Every product of that company feels like an effort to manipulate me into several predetermined categories by them. Unless i need to use their products professionally they wont recieve a single buck from me.,
Really attention to detail that the wallpaper on the macbook Air is actually newly realised Nasa's space photo from James Webb telescope 🔭,
"Here's why it's a refresh:

webcam - They are just catching up to others.  Especially during covid.  720p was embarrassing
SSD (256GB) - They have taken a serious step back from Air M1
RAM is still at 8GB
Processor is just a refresh and throttles to seriously lows if used repeatedly.

Cost is $200 more from the M!!!  If the price stayed the same then it would be a refresh.  In Canada the 512gb model and (ONLY 8gb ram) is $2000!!",
"Is this 24GB RAM MBA ?   , Nice video & Thanks :)",
"""...the FINGERPRINT-iest laptop..."" lol",
🥱,
"Ah yes a slowed 256gb storage , their claims of M1 ultra's performance were all destroyed by testers and finally this , apple never fails to disappoint",
It’s look like Acer 🤣,
That midnight color is pretty similar to the iPhone 5 slate black color!,
"It is a tool, who cares if it gets scratched? You pamper your drill too?",
That Intro 🔥🔥,
crazy we live in an age where buying a new laptop is on the same level as buying a car,
It’s a magnificent laptop… I dream about it,
Awesome review.. thanks dude.,
Nice intro,
I went for 256GB - but 16GB of unified memory. The reason being that I’m planning to use iCloud sync and there will be less stress on the SSD with less memory swaps.,
1:33 Sick flip!,
Awesome intro 🥰👍 I want this Laptop Marques. Tik Tok 😁,
bro got that apple event intro,
"Being a musician, I maxed my m1 out, travel a lot, still not enough space. Guess I'll wait for the m2pros then.",
That tape to know where to place the MacBook in the intro though 👀. Haha great intro guys,
You could get a zephyrus at this price point with like a 3070 lol,
Oh okay so no one is gonna talk about the wallpaper,
I have the same James Webb Telescopes wallpaper on my M1 Max. Such a cool pic!,
"For me the most disappointing thing about Apple Silicon is that (if I understand correctly) it won't run two external monitors. This seems a bit odd, given that's been possible with most previous models.",
include some active cooling solutions with maybe a small fan I guess. Near to full use of the silicon is more desirable than making it 100 gm lighter imo. Also OEM's are getting away with anything now. My 375$ machine can have an external monitor to right and has sd card slot and has more ports. I mean these are the basics..right!? Basics should be respected and then extra features should be added.,
Nice wallpaper.,
Fingerprintiest... hehe,
"1:28 got the same wallpaper, The Hubble pics were awesome.",
the Midnight color makes it look like the Pixelbook.,
Wallpaper >>>,
BTW Like D new intro,
Who buys MacBook air for serious editing ?,
The title is thd biggest cope,
Slow SSD. Slower than M1 at 256 gb of storage...,
"So tell me I need an clear answer, for whom this M2 Air base model is for ? Will it getting slow for me which I’m a super basic user (Netflix 4K, web browsing, email..) ? Because I could get the M1 Air but this design is so slick",
"To me, ssd proplem is not actually proplem.",
"And....if i say that there is a laptop with the same thickness and more functionality...like real USB port, HDMI, Card Reader, 4G modem, Touch Display etc?...and cost half the price? Buy a Thinkpad. You thank me later.",
I’ve never owned a MacBook I just purchased this exact one I’m pretty excited. Hopefully I didn’t make a mistake in just jumping into buying this model. Great vid as always 🤘🏼,
I’m noticing these big tech reviewers are wearing masks again. I wonder if they are told to do so?,
It's more than a refresh and that is why its slower than my m1. lol,
What was the second smartwatch u were wearing and how is it,
One of the best intro's ever,
"Btw, a total apple fanboy video. It deserves more criticism than in this video",
what wallpaper is this? I need it asap,
"Marquees! You’ve done it again. Excellent review, very insightful.",
❤️✨✨❤️,
So glad i got the space grey.,
wtf was that introoo dudee,
Where to find the wallpaper ?,
Great intro,
"I'm disappointed that you're not triple masked @ 2:57 as anyone scared and afraid and concerned because of coronavirus should be like I am! I don't go anywhere without being quadruple vaccinated, I don't touch anything or anyone, and I always use three to four masks all the time, even at home. You should set an example, and using just one mask is as good as voting for trump!",
"I just can’t get used to apple keyboard. I don’t know why, maybe the keys arrangement. I tried Microsoft surface laptop 4 and it’s more comfortable for typing, and it’s thin and lightweight too, plus the touchscreen..
hey @MKBHD, do a comparison between those 2…",
"I recommend 2x dramatic zoom on ""take really good care of it"" 🤣",
"Oooo, nice motion control camera move.",
sick intro,
Loooooved the intro,
But how does it compare with the Intel rivals?,
"All those colors should be available in every MacBook, at least this dark color one. That looks awesome❣️🤯",
Taped the table for a great landing 😁👍,
Nice transition!,
oh wow a review on an apple product...................,
Love the JWST Carina Nebula wallpaper!,
"The ""problem"" for the MBA is that it punches above it's weight class since Apple put in their own chips.  We now want to use it for EVERYTHING, like video and photo editing, coding, and running VMs.  The fact it can is incredible (even though it is Apple's entry level laptop).  So we want to upgrade it to make those higher-end tasks run better and that's where we run into trouble.  It's pricey and the 14"" MBP has already set the price-point for higher level performance and features.  There is a narrow band for where the MBA makes sense if you want to push it. So the real answer is probably that the Air is for light users and the Pros are for everyone else.  Isn't that what Apple intended in the first place?",
"the production quality on that intro! maaaaaaan, Top Notch!",
Got the M1 air today. Hands doesn’t he best laptop I have ever used! It’s perfect!!!,
I thought the M was going to change to MKBHD,
I want the blue one... And some gloves to hold it 😂,
Tell me what you don't love about it Mohawk man,
the casey nesistat shirt goes hard 💕,
"nice one. I got an M1 air, more than happy with it. It's such a massive step up from an intel and spanks the ass of my work laptop that costs 3 times as much. I will probably wait and get the M4 as an upgrade coz I don't need more",
"14"" MacBook Pro is the best choice.",
Imagine having more than a grand just chilling in the app store 😂 fair play,
"Air M2 + 10-Core GPU + 512GB SSD + 24GB RAM + MIDNIGHT = ROCK 'n Roll 🤘
In terms of the thermal issues simply apply Thermal Pads easily & you should be good to GO 👍
Yeah, the costs are almost insane BUT this would be a sustainable investment for next the 5 years at least. 
Also consider about  2 more years of updates compared to the Air M1.",
"1TB pcie 4.0 SSD ~ $120.   
Apple: ""add 256gb for $200 more""",
"It's a full 300 euros of a difference between the M1 Air in Europe so that's a 300 dollar difference which makes it an even harder sell, especially with the downgrade in SSD speeds. I waited for this but decided to get the 16 inch instead. It's not worth the price, especially if you upgrade to the 16gb ram and  512gb, the 14 inch is much better value. I saw both in the store and the 14 inch and the M2 display quality is a night and day difference, even just looking at the quality of the dock. The M2 Air display resolution and PPI is exactly the same as the first retina display from 2012 which is nuts for what you're paying. When it's standing beside the Pro Macbooks you see just how outdated the M2 Air display is by  2022 standards. You're going from one of the most outdated displays on the  market to the best display on the market jumping to the 14 inch. The M2 Macbook Air is a really bad buy for what you're getting for your money. You're really just paying hundreds more for a new design.",
the most confusing macbook lineup ever.. soooo hard to choose,
LOOOVE the intros,
How the hell did you film that intro so smoothly?,
A $1200 laptop with only 8BG of RAM is ridiculous. I know so many people who will use up that ram way before they use up the processing power. It should have started with 16GB,
That intro is really out of this world! Well done,
You still look off camera while talking. Why?,
Amazing intro and awesome vid. 🔥,
Is it worth buying the m2 MacBook Pro for an extra £100 as I do like the Touch Bar but also like the midnight air aswell as the MagSafe charging the extra power of the pro isn’t really what I need as the air will be just fine so is it really worth the extra £100,
The intro 😮,
"Clear, well balanced review, which defines clearly what this mac is, and what is not.  It helps potential buyers to ask themselves the right questions. Congratulations Marques.",
I Love that Stunning JWST images theme throughout the review. Nice work Marques. Peace ✌️,
"Sir You can giveaway any Previous Laptops, as a young developer I need it 🙏",
00:01 saw the cello tape to correctly place the mac!,
Wallpaper?,
who makes that shirt you are wearing in this video?,
I need a small and light laptop with amazing battery life for everyday use. I have a beefy one but it's not small and light!,
8 GB of RAM and 256 GB internal storage. That's some 2014 stuff.,
The Casey Neistat tshirt  👓🤍,
Dave 2D does a great job of showing the heat when doing long renders.,
Thank you for this,
Bahaha using the same wallpaper!,
Spent 1/3 of the video talking about color. Dave2D gave me more decision-relevant information in 5min than you did in 10min+,
Can you please give me one of your MacBook for my project,
"If it is only going to get 2 USB-C ports, one on each side would have been better.",
I thought I was going to need a new laptop today after spilling coffee on my late 2014 MacBook pro thankfully we're good.,
"Helpful, very. Clear me now that the M1 air with 16/512 gigs would fine for me.",
Can you machine learn on this or do I need the macbook pro for that?,
I have MacBook Pro m1 and the speed is enough for me,
"Love your videos Marcus. You d come a long way and its is super top the camera and editing, congrats!",
Great review but most important of all........where did you get that tee?  I am in the eyewear industry and that is a must have.  Little help!!!,
The Intro😍😍,
"I tried space gray, and this blue seems similar. Silver has always been the best Macbook color. Contrast with keyboard and no visible dust/finger prints, it looks the best to me.",
"One thing to consider on the comparisons to 14"" MBP: MBA is way nicer computer to use. Yes, MBP is truly great and runs rings around MBA when it comes to specs and performance. But it's also very substantial computer. It's pretty big, with substantial weight. It's not a device you just grab with you when heading out. It's not a device you really could carry in a backpack wherever you go. MBA is that computer.

My personal computer is the baseline M1 MBA. I also have a work-issued 14"" MBP with M1 Max CPU. Basically at the opposite ends of performance and capabilities when it comes to MacBooks. Both computers are available for me to use, and the one I choose to use for everyday things, is the MBA.

So when you spec up the MBA, you will start entering MBP territory on pricing. And the MBP is way more capable device. But being just such a nice device to use is also worth something.",
"Bro the entirety if reddit will hate him for saying the storage  is the only necessary upgrade, everyone talks abt the need to upgrade the ram for EVERYONE",
Intro!!!! Another one,
How they put thunderbolt port in that? Isn’t that Intel proprietary property?? I thought that’s why AMD machines doesn’t come with one..,
This comment is spam,
The intro looks like an awesome commecrial :D,
Nice intro man 🔥,
The intros keeps getting better and better,
Suggest… suh-jest,
Intro game,
is nobody gonna talk about the intro? it’s crazy good,
Why are fingerprints and scratches a big deal? It’s a computer. Just use the motherfucker and don’t worry about it.,
We need a 2 in 1 MacBook with apple pencil support,
Love the shoutout to Brian Tong,
"wha an intro man, just loved it...",
Me who just bought my M1 Pro yesterday: this is good news lol,
"I’m seriously considering this laptop and had already resigned myself to the fact that it would be more like £1,500 rather than £1,200. However, I was thinking the increase would come from the need to bump the RAM up from 8GB to 16GB to future proof myself a little more. Is the slower SSD really that much of an issue that it is recommended to leave the RAM where it is and pop in the 512GB SSD? Is 8GB of RAM perfectly sufficient? I would mainly be using it for document writing and web browsing/research. Any advice/further clarity on how best to future proof this laptop to have the most headroom for these kinds of tasks in the coming years would be really greatly appreciated. 😊",
"Hi MKBHD, just wondering how the computer performs when running an external monitor? Is it pretty seamless or does it tend to overheat fairly quickly thus throttling performance? Thanks!",
"Amazing intro.
Finally someone pointing out that this is supposed to be a computer for school and stuff, not a creative's workmachine. That's the Pro's!
However, well pointed out that to make this Air ""worth it"" long-term we get into a territory of being able to spend a couple bucks more and buying a Pro which is...comparably miles better.
Weird choices from Apple this year...",
"""This machine is for the everyday use of 30 chrome tabs or 15 apps open at once"".........🤣🤣🤣 Dude what are you talking......? for this purpose my Dell lattitude i3 4th gen laptop is more than sufficient and does justifies the price point (second hand about 15 to 20K)..... why should people spend around 1200$ only to perform daily taks......🤷‍♂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂",
NO!! the M2 Macbook Pro will throttle. Check Maxtech's video on that!,
"I was so waiting for this Device, but with 1TB Storage and 16GB Memory (not even maxed out) its already at 2100 Bucks in central europe. I rather took a deal on a 16"" MBP with the M1 Pro, also 16 gigs ram and 1tb storage but for 2495 at a local store. As pointed out when i get up in the 2-2.5k area anyway it doesn't matter too much anymore and the display alone is worth the price, not to speak of the even better battery, way higher performance, more ports and better speakers.

I feel like a decently specced (not highend) MBA M2 is way overpriced. 16GB/1TB Version for 1499 and i am sold. For 2100 ? No fucking way ever.",
Marqueef Brownnose is a paid shill should be banned and sued.,
I love how MKBHD just jumps right into the video and doesn't waste our time. Also very informative! Thanks for this video!,
Not sure If I would ever buy any apple product without actually watching your reviews first...Thanks Marques!,
That intro was fucking sick,
"supreme quality intro and video overall. Literally, there is only apple is higher. For now. :)",
MKB why is this video not marked as containing paid promotion when you clearly give a sponsored recommendation for dbrand’s products?,
"I was waiting for this video!
I only trust your honest opinion.
Thx",
That beginning scene tho. Cold af 🥶,
Thanks a lot for review. How about M2's throttling ?,
My code is enough to bring it to halt 😤,
The finger scratches problem in pro is also too much. I do use M1 pro and man it's really impossible to keep it clean also the screen is so clean that every single drop of dust is visible and that's quite embarrassing.,
"To be honest I’m so pumped to get the Starlight color, the Midnight just looks so basic to me.",
"Hi all, answer each of the following questions separately at first: Question 1) do you think it is too much to spend $1,349 (student pricing - $150 gift card) for a M2 Macbook Air with 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD?   Question 2) How about if I could get the entry level 14"" M1 Macbook Pro with 16 GB RAM and 512GB SSD for $1,719 (just $370 more than the M2 Air).  Question 3) Considering that the future M2 14"" Macbook Pro is probably just 6-9 months away, should I just wait and get the new to come M2 14"" Macbook Pro for the same $1,719? and Final Question 4) Since all I want to do with a macbook is to learn to code Xcode, should I just get the entry level M1 Macbook Air with 8GB RAM and 256GB SSD for $749? (that's $600 less than the M2 Macbook Air, $970 less than the M1 14"" Macbook Pro.  The only reason I want the 16 GB RAM/512GB SSD M2 Air is because of the M2's slow SSD - otherwise, if the SSD was as fast as the M1 Air, then I would get the 8GB RAM /256gb SSD M2 Air.   But since the M2 Air SSD is so slow, I have to get the 512GB SSD with 16GB RAM).  To sum up:  what would you buy or not buy yet: (1) a M1 Air w 8GB RAM/256GB SSD for $749, (2) a M2 Air w 16GB RAM/512GB SSD for $1,349, (3) a M1 14"" Macbook Pro w 16GB RAM/512GB SSD for $1,719, or (4) wait 6 to 9 months for the new to come M2 14"" Macbook Pro that will probably come out at the same price as the current M1 14"" Macbook Pro?",
"Something to note, in Europe it’s even more expensive as a base price!  £1,249 STARTING price here for example……",
Your videos are getting sicker and sicker 🔥,
"Appreciated the JWST shoutout.
That Carina wallpaper is 🔥 🔥 🔥",
Jonny Ive is probably screaming rn looking at this new color having scratches and fingerprints all over,
"M1 Air is probably the best deal on the market. I have a 2020 M1 Air 16gb ram. You will be happy with have powerful and consistent it is. Unless you're a power user running editing software, or doing some heavy programming.",
In this household we watch our MKBHD intros.,
haah haha fingerprintiest laptop 💻,
I always come to see the intro,
I really like the blue,
brian tongs channel will grow now :D,
Definitely the best laptop on the market today 😏👍✨,
Midnight is really just paying homage to the original black MacBook.,
You're good at this. Keep it up you might make a living out of it :P,
that's a hella intro. and yeah i got a little dizzy hahahaha,
Love the background!,
Dbrand shill,
That intro was just 🤌🏻,
When you notice you have the same wallpaper as Marques. JWST op.,
1000Gb ssd should be the new standard!,
"It should  be noted that Brownlee is a sell-out Fruit Fly.   He is beyond a fanboi.   He is a complete cluster of Fruit Flies and nothing he says can be taken with any objective nature.

First, there is no compelling reason for a computer so thin as a Fruitbook Air.   I know modern snowflakes like Brownlee are weak and whine when they have to carry an extra ounce of anything (but don't mind carrying a pound of dongles).    The Fruit company knows that there is a segment of the population who will buy a Fruitbook Air instead of a real laptop and hence you get this one with a new color and a host of bait and switch performance snafus.    A real company that gave a damn about its products would just offer Fruitbooks with fans and then start from there.   But thin is in and lazy and weak fools like Brownlee will swoon for the con job.

And still not one touch screen from the Fruit company all while lowly Windows machines have them at nearly every price point.",
Do you think it's worth an upgrade if I just got my M1 macbook?,
"Cool, I like it",
"For anyone asking what the wallpaper is, it's one of the new James Webb Space Telescope releases - you'll find it on NASA's website.",
get a msi 3070 laptop not this lol,
Gotta rewatch the intro. Holy moly 😍,
"I have a question for you. Maybe you can give me a suggestion for which MacBook i should chose. My current MacBook Pro is 2017 13 inch version 256GB. And I am thinking changing it. I am struggling choosing pro or m2 air. Cause I will be start doing some video editing. But not mainly for it. So the problem is will M2 air fit my daily basis? If i want to buy M2 air, I will chose 24 GPU 8 core and 1 TB version.",
Intro!!,
"You omitted the largest difference between the M2 Air and the 14 inch MBP in that latter comparison, wherein the Air wouldn’t even be able to perform such sustained workflows given its lack of fans. And so yes, while the 14 inch MBP does have a better display, etc etc as you mentioned, the main problem lies in the lack of fans, which you did mention in the beginning interestingly, which is why no one would (or at least shouldn’t) even consider the Air for sustained workflows, regardless of whether they max out the RAM and storage. Great vid nonetheless.",
I think it's the only M2 review that hit the nail in the head.  M2 should thought of as £1.5k device rather than £1k like M1 that's 50% (!!!) more expensive than M1. Makes little sense at the moment with 14 Pro almost the same price but no doubts apple will hike the price of M2 14 Pro so that M2 looks like a bargain. Greed doesn't know limits.,
"Basically, it's better than the M1 Air, but not $300-500 better.",
I am pretty sure that was the robot arm that made the intro. Dope 😎,
I see those tape marks to get the position of the laptop right on the table :D,
MKBHD intros are legendary! Thank you for spoiling us with perfection!,
honestly the m2 air ain't really a tock. it's more like a second tick.,
"You don't know how much I appreciate the handmade subtitles, so the translation is much better, I'm Latino, from Uruguay, I'm fascinated by technology and honestly there are no channels of this level in Spanish, the subtitle translation feature really changed my YouTube watch date",
Love the dedication put in every video!♥️,
"apple was all about aesthetic and power now all apple macbooks looks like lenovo and hp i used to admire apples aesthetic especially in  MB air but now it looks plain dumb 
i knda miss the jonathan eve era",
"Intro was good, but you gotta remove those markers from the table. Ruined the illusion for me 🥲",
I’ve been wondering if the base or the upgraded option would be better for me. I am looking for a laptop to strictly use for writing for as long as possible I’ve attempted cheap windows PCs and they all die within 2 years and chrome books are hot garbage. Is the $1500 for the 512gb model worth it if it lasts me a decade of writing?,
I would say it’s not suitable for coding as compiling stuff can be a long sustained load.,
"is there any difference between the 1 tera and the 256 gb capacity in the speed of
the notebook..?",
Everyone saw stickers on a table^ for positioning MacBook? in first shot?,
the intro ❤‍🔥❤‍🔥❤‍🔥,
Love the cheeky Daft Punk shoutout,
My god that intro 🤌🏻,
I completely agree on pricing - I initially pre-ordered an upgraded MBA but after a week realized I may as well get a 14” MBP for only $100/more which is all around a better machine,
i like ur glasses,
Incredible intro 👍🏾,
That intros on another level 10/10,
Where can i get the wallpaper? Its amazing!,
The new colour is fire. Easily my favorite,
"The MacBook Pro 14"" is nice and obviously the better choice if you *really* need this kind of power on a mobile device. However, it's significantly thicker and you'll surely notice the weight difference if you have to carry it constantly. My old 16"" MBP became very annoying, very quickly exactly because of the heavy weight (compared to the MBA).

The M2 MacBook Air is a nice device which easily gives one a great laptop experience for >5 years. Considering this none of the available Windows machines can compete to the package the MacBook Air (also the M2) provided considering the investment costs.

Too bad the Midnight color seems to be really that annoying and making it look dirty, it's therefore a No-Go for me. The 256GB issue is bad on Apple and deserves all the bad press and shame while it won't affect me personally. In my opinion the 256GB are way too tight nowadays, despite cloud storage. People who're price sensitive see this more negatively, I get and understand that.",
Would be cool to see the team on editing and production for these videos! Seeing a lot of comments about how good the videos have been recently :),
Good solid review - thanks 👍🏼,
Thank you for acknowledging the overpricing,
Cool so you pay 1200 $ so you can open 15 tabs at the same time wooow 🤣,
Apple pricing always feels like such a rip off! What's the 'closest equivalent' Windows laptop to consider / compare to this M2 MacBook Air?,
"""15 apps open at once, just the NORMAL stuff going on""
Meanwhile Me freaking out after opening 3 apps at once.",
Intro is just 🔥🔥🔥......,
I’ve noticed that recently I have been watching the intros at least three times before continuing with rest of the video. 👌,
8GB of memory is just unacceptable,
"Just buy Acer swift, it cool better for me as a web developer and cheap compared with MBA M2",
Wearing a mask? Really? What? You find wearing a mask sheek? Come On Man I highly doubt the environment where you shot that was such that you couldn't lost the mask? Stop it!,
this man looks like shaun the sheep with black hair,
That water drop on the table in the intro...,
wallpaper link please !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
The intro feels like it was made by apple....,
"If you can’t decided i think you should get the 14 inch model. I brought it few weeks ago and its wonderful. The laptop never gets too hot, the fans dont turn on often and when they do you can’t even hear it. The screen is fantastic. Levels and i mean levels above the 12.9 iPad Pro.",
Isn’t it time to rename yourself to MKB4K? Or MKB8K? 😀,
Anyone know if my 2014 128 gig mba has two 64 gig ssd chips?,
The intro was fire 🔥,
"Can someone suggest which accessories would be good for a MacBook m2, how to insert pendrives and connect to hdd or sdd ?",
I am wondering whom is Macbook Air targeting right now?,
"Sou do Brasil
Tenho uma maquina Craftsmam ela é uma cnc router pequena 
não encontro assistência aqui poderia ajudar?",
I just love that MKBHD and I chose to use the same picture as our wallpaper this week 🥺🤓,
"this is the best video for the day, I enjoyed watching... bbb",
Someone get me that wallpaper !! 🤩,
Hot damn that into was smooth. Nice one.,
Intros 🔥🔥🔥,
The tape markers in the intro shot to align the MacBook perfectly in center. The precision of perfection in your videos is 'top-notch'.,
the james webb telescope images and references are a nice touch,
"M1 = Get people to switch from Intel and rebuild software to make use of the new architecture; M2 = Okay people did that, now let's make bank. And honestly, the M1 is so freaking good for my day-to-day work as a software engineer (16GB 8/8), I'm expecting the M2 to be so much better, especially with that slightly larger screen <3",
"Absolutely killing it with the intros. They are so original, so good, and literally increase the already EXTREMELY HIGH quality videos by an absolute TON. Keep it up man!",
"Important detail: Apple discontinued the M1 Air with 8 GPU cores last month. So they’ve also made the M1 Air worse.
The M2 air is a beautiful machine, but I don’t get it. The base model with 256GB/8GB is a joke for the price. With better specs it gets very expensive, even way more expensive in many other countries. So you’re either buying an outdated 1200 dollar laptop for browsing the web, or spending close to 2000 dollars (more than that abroad) for a decent MacBook Air. And if it could run all the software I wanted, I might consider it. But with an ‘ecosystem’ this limited and more closed than ever, I just can’t do it. Shame, because the ARM-based chips have so much potential. I’ll just get a Ryzen 6800u ultrabook instead, with a nice touchscreen and all the extra versatility.",
Why increase the HD rather than just the RAM?,
Nvidia needs to upgrde their nvenc to absolutely demolish apple otherwise soc stuff will kill gpu first,
that intro!!!!!!!!!!!,
💚Thank you!,
I will be buying the old MacBook Air.,
"In need of a new laptop, is the m1 16gb/256gb storage a good choice? I waited for the m2 reveal and was disappointed with the ssd issue and heating, plus it’s way more money to get 16gb/512gb.",
Mad intro! daft punk easter egg lol.,
The intros 🔥🔥,
I like the form factor and color (midnight). But I cannot get over the damn notch. It drives my OCD crazy. I will not upgrade.,
I'm expecting to hear less reports of the feet not being level on this one. Only real problem with my M1 :/,
it work on my pc thx bro vеry much,
"I'm someone who uses my phone on the lowest possible brightness and eye comfort turned on while using at night. But when I clicked on this, i first bumped brightness to maximum and turned off eye comfort to see that sweet intro!  DAMN! THEY ARE SOO GOOD AT IT!",
I’d say the only thing I hate about the new air as well as the redesigned pros is those square-shaped functional keys. They just look out of place there.,
mark ass brownie,
Swaure Plate DEsign SUpremacy ...It's look slick clean from other side,
As always writing a comment to support the channel,
$999 M2Air could’ve easily dominated the world of entry level laptop with great price-performance ratio. But Apple being Apple just decided to fuck it up both in pricing and shady storage downgrade.,
That intro shot 😍,
I just can’t get myself to pull the trigger knowing it fully passive cooling. I expect my laptop to perform as advertised consistently. The throttling is just unacceptable,
Apple will soon hire MKBHD Team to make ads for their campaigns. (That intro though),
"Intel its still a crap, the 12 GEN are super inefficient

and 13 GEN is tha same shit",
"As an upcoming college student, who wants nothing but a fancy laptop as a nice gift to
myself. the 256Gb is more than enough for the possible nonexistent workload I’ll be doing on it x-x",
Love the intro,
what a joke,
That subtle dave2d comment 🤣🤣,
At 1400 i d buy a gaming laptop everyday of the week,
I am a physics student in CSU Fresno. What should I buy? M1 air or m2 air? Suggestions are greatly appreciated.,
that animation tho,
Well you got some actual next level video editing going on in your videos! Always the most visually pleasing experience watching your vids!,
The intros legit have been at a whole new level lately goht damnnnn,
The intro 👀🔥,
Buying the MBA M2 with 16GB Unified memory and 256 GB SSD would suffice for a single NAND chip - This should be the most affordable specs available in the line up which doesn't slow down the speed and hence the performance.Also would like to know about accessories recommended for the M2 MacBook Air @MKBHD,
Please give me 1 pes,
I really like the new MB Air but it starts at 1499€ in Germany and the Dollar is currently 1:1 to the Euro...,
Thank you for shouting out Brian Tong. One of the OG’s in the Apple game and makes great videos!,
should I wait for the price drop?,
"It starts at $1499 in germany, $1199 would be awesome…",
Does the baseline Macbook Air M1 also have the SSD issue?,
Had to like just for that intro,
Where I can find that wallpaper??,
10:19 Actually you can get the 14'' MB Pro M1-Pro for $1799 on Amazon.,
This channel now is just another Apple advertising scam,
That intro! (like),
Where can i get the james web wallpaper,
Midnight looks *chef's kiss*,
It's not cool to have to carefully weigh the high cost of adding just 8gb of ram.,
Those animations!! Gorgeous intro.,
How can one be that creative with the intros. Hats off Marques and team! I used to enjoy every bit of your videos. But the intro is that much hooking  feels like out of the box thinking is also out of the box. <3,
"Scuffs?!?! What scuffs, YOU’RE CHARGING IT WRONG!",
This new case makes it look like a regular macbook. Missing that iconic razor thin front edge,
Still not a fan of the notch but god does it look beautiful otherwise.,
I received my MacBook Air M2 Silver yesterday it’s amazing,
Can you maybe make a video explaining why the European models START at 1500€? This is such a big price difference that it makes the MacBook Air M2 a high end laptop instead of an entry model one…,
"Apple need to stop the 256go SSD, it's a bit stupid especially in 2022 and with the price of the upgrade.",
The tape on the desk to align the laptop...OCD alert,
Wow that intro!!! 🔥🔥🔥🎉,
"Jesus!!! What an intro!!! Apple will start hiring you guys for its presentations, I’m telling you",
"Just a FYI, coding is a sustained load in many cases especially in real-world production scenarios",
"I was more impressed on the intro then the review, thank you",
"Change my mind: the MacBook Air is the answer to an iPad running macOS, but no touch",
where are you getting the high resolution photos of of the james webb images? the nasa website doesnt seem to have high quality images for a wall paper,
Loving these sick intros !,
That Webb background though 😍,
"I bought it to replace my macbook pro 2015. For work, I do basic word, pdf, excel etc. editing, and its an absolute gem! 
Please stop judging laptops based on rendering 4k outputs etc.

 99% of people are not video and content creator, so we do not care about doing these powerful tasks.",
"if you really wanna budget but still get a macbook, the M1 Macbook Air often goes on sale for 900 or even 800",
That introoooo 🔥🔥🔥,
wow.. that intro man..,
anyone else experienced that youtube doesnt go comnpletely fullscreen on the M1Max-MacbookPro's? theres quite a large bezel in each side (using firefox),
yet another incredible intro!,
"The Apple that I used to love is long gone. And I'm someone that grew up with Performas 420 and 630 and the first iMac as our daily computers. My 2009 unibody white MacBook has served me perfectly until last year and cost me only 999,-. But with these prices I rather went and bought a Dell and now run Linux (manjaro), which to me feels a lot like Apple in a way, at least compared to Wintendows. Perfect! I now have an 12th Gen i7, rtx3060, 16 gigs ram, 1tb, 1080p Webcam and a nice 16"" screen for 1750€. I'm happy as can be.

I also dumped my iPhone last year in favor of a Samsung. The integration I now have with KDE Connect between Linux and Android is amazing.

Good bye Apple.",
DUUUDDDEEEEE. THAT INTRO....,
Just showing what a con Apple is!,
Watched the intro like 3 times. Beautifully edited and really creative.,
Meanwhile being an ARM it might as well be an iPad. Smfh,
Where can I get that wallpaper HD?,
I hate when bloggers put their hand on the camera. it is like putting a hand on my eyes!,
Will it push 4k at 120hz now? Right now 4k is capped at 60hz on apple laptops.,
That intro! 🤌🏾,
wow nice intro! smoothhh !!!,
"Looks like a great laptop but it's impossible to justify what is essentially a chores laptop. It's not really built for professional work so all you're really gonna use it for is youtube, finances, bills, casual internet browsing, twitter etc etc etc. The price isn't right for the use case in my opinion, but I'm sure it'll be exactly what some people need. If it stayed at 999 I probably would've snapped it up, even with the low (by modern standards) ssd capacity",
"I have the 14 inch MacBook Pro so this doesn't apply to me but I'm curious, what do you think would be better, spending $200 on 16GB of memory, or spending $200 on the 512GB model, because assuming you only need 256GB of SSD, wouldn't it be better to just buy more RAM anyways?",
Google pixelbook 2 better come correct after this!,
Insane intro 🔥🤩 well done marques and team,
Looks like I can really hear your exhaust fan in your studio,
"Portland, JAMAICA in the Building !!!!!!!",
What mac should I buy? The m1 air or the m2 air? I am a student and I want a pc to do school work and watch some videos and maybe play some games like stardew valley or something little more “aggressive” than that,
M1 air vs M2 air. Thats the comparison I want to see. On the M1 I could have a lot of applications open with no issues,
this is the video I needed so I don't buy this machine and save for the next macbook pro with this design,
I absolutely love how Marques talks in these videos. Feels so effortless and conversational,
"I hope you're wearing the Casey t-shirt because of the video he made a while ago about the MacBook charging cable. If yes, genius choice of warderobe 👏",
the best review of all youtubers..........,
I've lost count on how many times I watched the first shot. Amazing,
I just ordered an M2 MBA a couple days ago. I got the 16GB RAM upgrade (seemed like a no brainer) and the 512GB SSD because I was worried that the SSD situation would be the same as the MBP... looks like I was right.,
I highly recommend m1 MacBook Pro 13 inches... not made me any sad for editing photos and videos. one time charging im using up to 15 hrs. its like you have Ferrari 2021 Ferrari but there's 2022 thinking about if its worth it or you really need it ? if you're not high level of pros (they need studio Macs btw :) ) m1 pro versions are gonna be ok for y'all min 5 more years,
"Students .... tell me what is this color ?
*It's MKBHD teacher ....*
What ?
*Sry... actually its Matt Black* 😒",
Master shots book ftw,
Nice James Webb image,
That intro was insane!!!,
I'm a poli sci professor and the most I do is python and R. Do you think I'll be affected by the SSD issue?,
laptops don’t have to have good camera,
"I said I wanted to wait and watch your review of the laptop first. I gotta say man, you didn't disappoint.. you didn't disappoint.",
Apple wants money,
Dude I really like your background from on your mac!,
"Hi Marques, just a correction. The M2 MacBook Pro also has just 2 USB-C ports, not 4.",
"I have the base model and love it. I feel like a lot of reviewers and people generally get caught up in the upgrades and SSD issue but forget that most people aren't pushing their machines that hard. As always, it depends on what an individual needs, but I have to disagree with the idea that this laptop should be considered a ""$1500"" laptop. This is a great review, but I don't think the base model should be discounted by reviewers as much as it has been, especially when you consider the student price is $1099.",
That intro tho! Nice.,
Cool! I'm going to get the m1 when it's cheap second hand stuff,
I love it when you talk doubt sustained loads. 😛,

thanks man. keep up the great work!,
"Thank you, Marques! Very thorough and helpful review of this MacBook Air. I took a peek at one of these dark ones in an Apple Store today, and I actually thought it was black, not dark blue. The Airs look a bit too thin and too light to me. A fragile sort of look for the price. I think Apple has gone a bit too anorexic for my taste. So I appreciate your comparison comments about the MacBook Pros.",
"hello marques...
Please talk about unlimited Internet and compare it with Internet in egypt pleasd talk about it
Unlimited Internet In Egypt",
"If the new M2 MB air had a 120 Hz display and two 128 GB SSDs, I would buy it but got 14 inch MB pro instead, it costs 1799 on amzn now.",
CAN WE GET THE FAKE AMwuaelsse sdfsefborenselees accounte???,
Apple products make me go bankrupt in The Netherlands with these outrages pricetags they have overhere,
"1) wow the ""M2"" idea at starting of the video was awesome...definitely you've got some of the finest people working around you..thumbs up man...
2) awesome MASTER SHOTS BOOK vol 1.",
at 5:15 the 4th option is... just don't be so anal about how perfect your laptop looks. Patina is cool.,
Hahahaha that Dave2D tweet,
Fantastic intro,
M2 mac book air or M1 macbook pro which is on clearance now?,
"As an engineering university student, I ordered the base m2 air(8gb ram, 256gb ssd). I’m not gonna run final cut & photoshop on it mainly microsoft office, zoom and AutoCAD every now and then. So the base seems perfect for me",
Great info and video! Thank you!!,
That intro tho!,
"SRB
 And see now they can't / ... If terhy have my strength / why are they not keeping people (their family safe ) /. ... But I'm ""supposed to be scared they are gointo harm them""//.yep , ecepxft , they were trying to break it /.I bet /but they are all useing the ""web cam/ ...you can even , use tthe ratio sing oor//yeah , wwiii/.  Allyou cell phones , ...yelling can you here's me ,now!!?!!",
This thing is overpriced,
"// THAT BLAST from the past Casey Neistat T-shirt is rad. Not to mention the phenomenal robot assisted intro was breathtaking, especially with the sweet M2 translation. Hats off 😉",
"After reading all of the responsible reviews, it’s clear that the ability to render video (as an example) is mostly for occasional convenience. The fact that you can do some 4K rendering is just amazing. Trying to compare this M2 MBA to an active cool system is for stunt purposes only. Otherwise, this might be the best ultra portable ever.",
That intro is apple keynote worthy 🥰,
Intro 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥,
That opening shot. I loved it man,
That T-Shirt reminded me of how much I miss Casey Neistats daily vlogs.,
the robot shot in the beginning aaah so good.,
The Casey shirt 🥺🥺,
The external monitor limitations are still a crazy thing to me.,
"I’m driving two displays with a display link dock, fyi",
"That is it just an insult to user's  putting 256GB of storage in any laptop in this day and age, for the price they are asking,  all laptops from Apple should start at 1TB.",
Typical apple crap.  Spend thousands of dollars for a laptop that can only do web browsing no gaming (steam). And is ultra sensitive to scratches.   I still have my MacBook Pro mid 2012 as back up. Still rocking actually still gets updates 😂😂,
Does anyone know where to find that wallpaper?,
MacBook Air a superb device from Apple.,
That's wallpaper is lit 🔥🔥,
"Uhhhh, can we talk about the motion control rig intro??",
"Disappointed with this model, really. 1,500€ for a base model of their most basic laptop. Couple that with a ridiculous 230€ bump for the 16GB of RAM that should come as standard. And top it off, for those poor enough to go for the 256GB model, screw you and get lower speeds. I was hoping for this to be my first Mac, but there's no way in hell I'm paying 1,500€ for an 8GB, 256SSD base model.",
Superb intro.,
same wallpaper!!,
I also used that as a wallpaper! Intro was soo soooo cool!!!,
"IMO, Apple will soon discontinue the M1 MBA, maybe by end of the year, and that's it, and then remaining option would be M2 MBA or MBP, there by inflating the prices of laptops and hence the whole laptop market.",
Is MKBHD paraphrasing the one and only Josep María Pedrerol? Tic tac mbappe,
Man that was a sick intro,
"Nice hardware, terrible software.
As a power user with a wide use from gaming to photo/video editing to school and watching media, iOS is just not for me, or people like me. But I do like Apple/Microsoft as a companies better than Google which lives on ads.",
Production quality just keeps getting better my giddy aunt🤌🤌🤌🤌🤌,
Ik no ones gonna agree with me but it looks like its made of plastic,
We should be sueing the fuckers,
The guys playing table tennis in the background were just a spice to the intro,
Wallpaper please,
"8:15 It is clear that what this laptop is capable of, but the cooling is abysmally bad.
People found ways to cool it better with $20 of thermal pads between the motherboard and the back panel.

Apple is just atrociously bad in cooling, their engineers need to go back to uni.",
That opening sequence was dope!,
Look Very nice😍,
How well does it run Minecraft,
You can not connect 2 external monitors on that!!! Apple really!!!! For 1200€ OMG,
god damn the intros keep getting better!,
The m1 MacBook Air in good condition is going for about $850 on the secondhand market now and that’s looking pretty attractive tbh,
"In other words its a pretty laptop that is slow, costs much and heats up alot after 5min aka bad laptop",
That intro was better than Apples Intro😂,
Daft Punk. Casey T.,
A person trying to steal corporate data from a midnight version will get caught before he leaves the building 😂😂,
Love the James Webb wallpaper. Great Video!,
Ill comment because i love the intro. 😂😂,
"I must say, I've been using the MB Air M1 256gb model since December 2021 now as my daily device for regular stuff you do when studying. My girlfriend on the other side is using the Asus Zephyrus ROG 14"" from 2020 also for studying and sometimes for gaming. So I had two devices to test that couldn't be more different. In terms of battery-life the M1 just kills the Zephyrus. The M1 MB Air is just such a great device if using for these daily-driver-things. 
On the other side you got a huge handicap if you want to use this thing for gaming. The Zephyrus can still run most games without any problems, but It gets really loud really quick.
So if you are searching a device only for basic stuff like studying, YouTube, or anything like that the MB Air M1 even with 256gb is unbeatable in terms of price and battery. I never had any issues with it.
If you want to play some games be sure to spend some more money then a 1000 bucks (at least if you're living in Europe....).  And if you want to play games, maybe spend some money on a self made Pc and buy an older iPad Pro 10.5"" for traveling. But these are just my thoughts. :)

Greetings from Germany and have a nice week!",
Peep the computer background,
"I want a MacBook really badly, but I feel I can wait till a MacBook comes out with faceID am I right? It’s only a matter of time",
M chips are not supporting many  apps,
"Pro models seem to have eclipsed the Air line entirely, both on laptops and tablets.",
So which macbook supports 2 extra monitors,
that intro tho...,
Marques up here making Apple adverts for intros,
I want that wall paper,
"You’d want to put external monitors on the right side of the machine not the same side as ports. If you’re propping it up for ergonomics. Otherwise you get a cable protruding into your external monitor. 

Very hard to describe this without a visual lol. 

Great video as always, you’re the man.",
"Does the m1 Macbook air have the same SSD issues that Marques mentioned with the m2? For example, does the base m1 air SSD have a single SSD module instead of two smaller ones?",
"I hate that Apple killed the wedge design, it was an amazing aspect",
"Thank you @mkbhd for comparing this M2 Air briefly to the 14 inch M1 Pro. As an owner of the [14"" M1 Pro] model specifically, I love that I already made a great choice when it was first revealed.",
"This is like giving you power and then restrict your use of your own power.this is. Bullshit. Just look at this. We talking about an m2 here and its power is deduced but yet they lie you its m2.bullshit. if you giving power,give power.dont give power and the steal some. This air version is pointless",
Incredible video as usual. Made me think about my next purchase 🙏🏼🤙🏼🔥,
I loved the james webb details.,
I seriously hate the notch on laptops. And I prefer the taper design. Sticking to M1 I guess LMAO,
"2:06 what do you know that we don't know? :) 
For reference look at the macbook camera title",
I think that M2 MacBook Air is still too cheap. Apple has to increase that price by at least 20%; there are plenty of people who need healing from the empty life in the pursuit of becoming one of the elite people. Just in case people from Apple read these comments.,
I am a college student planning to buy a MacBook for the student oriented basic workload. Should i go for the m1 macbook air 256gb or 256gb M2 macbook air since storage and ram are not an issue for me but the slow ssd speed and heating issue on m2 air is making me dubious..,
"I think Laptops like these do not make sense in India! M1 Air was 92K INR (now increased to 100K) and now M2 Air is 120K ($1500). Upgrade the RAM and SSD to 16GB and 512GB (minimum in 2022 I believe) the price will go up to 160K INR ($2000). We can get a comparable Windows laptop for around $1200 or so. It won't be as efficient as the mac, but the power will be there.",
Yo I’m 100k like let goo,
"what an intro, Man u are awesome 👏",
What an intro!,
So an iPad with keyboard,
Wow that intro 🙌,
"I'm waiting for the M2 16"" MacBook Pro.  I'm sure, like the M1 series, they'll upgrade it a bit and call it the M2 Pro or M2 Max or whatever.  But that's the one I want.  I want the 16"", Midnight, M2-series-SoC-equipped MacBook Pro.  What'd'ya figure -- 6 months before they release that?  Hopefully?  🙂",
very informative. Thank you.,
That's an intro for Apple made by MKBHD,
That intro is so sick. 60 fps please🥺,
How fast does this jawn get hot?,
Is it good for coding?,
"You nailed that intro. Whenever I see a new video, I have to look at that freaking good intro!",
"Its close to 14 in mbp but for every day casual user, they wont need 2tb ssd or 24 gb mem, the 16gb and 1 tb would be enough upgrade plus they get the fast charger for free, its still expensive 

Another thing you forgot to mention is that the 14 inch mbp you mention is the entry level, most people will upgrade to the middle spec plus add ram and storage and that will cost around $3000 to $4000

Significant on paper not in real world scenario

Aside from that if you have $3000 or more to spend you wont be looking at macbook air.. this more for people who are only willing to spend $2000 for a notebook, its more a choice of getting a mac or a windows notebook.",
Still no touch screen. Primitive !!,
No one likes that stupid Notch!!!,
"One funny thing about MKBHD is even when he lately post new stuffs, he makes an intro that makes you forget about other videos on the same content!! GOT DAMN Marquess and the team...Proud to be a fan since 2013🖖",
"Fingerprintiest laptop) It seems nobody liked this color among youtubers, looks good on the screen though.",
Really disappointing that it only supports 1 external monitor,
Do you think I should go for the $1499 m2 air if I am just going to do some casual browsing (maybe 15 tabs max) and watch some Netflix? I am buying my first mac and do not want m1,
"As a tech youtuber, it is your responsibility to clearly state that you only review Apple computers and have no database of windows laptops to compare with. You are basically advertising Apple products. Disappointed",
Cool to see the JWST Picture there!,
Ok macOS Yosemite at 2:50. I see you 👀,
i love it maybe il buy it,
"How does an M1 MB Pro (entry level configuration) compare with the M2 MB Air?  You can get the M1 MB Pro for around $1,100 now.  Thoughts?",
I think about the only way they could design a dark colored laptop that doesn't show fingerprints would be to add some type of texture to the surface and I don't know how they could do that.  That really looks sleek when it's clean though!,
wallpaper link,
Sick intro,
"Yooo plug the magsafe and then plug the usb-c into the laptops port. Now, will it charge itself?",
"That intro was 🔥🔥🔥 
Props to the team 🤘😎",
jwst!,
@MKBHD- What an intro shot .! 🤯👌🏻,
"I’m not a photo or video editor but even I would be concerned that my workflow would need a laptop with more memory than this. That base model sounds like something you just give to your kid to watch Netflix on, not a functioning computer.",
"So if I want an M2 MacBook Air to be faster, is it better to upgrade to 512GB SSD, or to 16GB RAM (if you could only pick one)?",
I am using the same wallpaper since this photo got into public.,
M3 mcbook air comes with 64GB m.2 SSD. Pay $500 for 128GB upgrade,
Should I install Antivirus on my Mac Pro 14 inch. You never made a video on this topic. Thanks.,
"As you just said people use it to watch YouTube and browse the web with stupid amount of Chrome tabs open, so where do you need that faster ssd then, most people wont notice any hiccups using the base model..",
Dopeeee intro 🤩,
"Hey I just bought one at 8 core, 1tb ssd and 16 gb of ram. Do you guys thinks that this is a good overall choice?",
All black always looks good I havent cared for apple laptops (but i use iphone and ipad) but i kinda want this,
Matte Blacks and fingerprints - sounds like RAZER xD,
"8GB of RAM should not be an option in a 1200 dollar laptop in 2022. In the M1 Macs it already felt like a bad option, and it is even worse now, 2 years later.",
I don’t know why but the midnight colour looks badass to me. I don’t look at the scratches or fingerprints that I’m going to get on it.,
"I use my M2 Pro 13 as an office workhorse and it has no issues with the storage speed (rarely a process goes above 1Mb/s. I have 20 apps open (most just light for office work) with 7-9 Safari tabs. That barely ever needs more than 400Mb of swap so no slow downs, and has 1-2GB of RAM ready for opening apps. 

If I was a hobbyist, semi or pro media editor I certainly would buy the MB Pr 14/16 as that is what they are designed for. The MB Air is for the consumer, casual user, office work, media streaming, etc. Even Apple said in an interview do not buy it for sustained workloads as it is not designed for that, which to a sensible person should be obvious (no fan). 

The price is comparable with other premium base models in Windows-land. As for the NAND speed, the 256GB is faster than the 512GB Galaxy Book 2 Pro when both on battery.",
"I need help. Would you rather buy:
1) M1 MBA 16/256 GB for 1 250€
2) New M2 MBA 8/256 GB for 1 530€
3) M1 MBP 8/256 GB for 1 258€

I like to play video games sometimes, and I'm learning how to code, but the macbook would be used mostly for browsing, youtube etc...",
"been debating getting an M1 or M2 (as a typical college student, maybe a bit of coding/video editing), should I go with an M1 and uprade to 16gb of ram which puts it at $1079 ($20 cheaper than base M2 model), or get an M2 and purchase an external SSD (or upgrade to a 512gb) to avoid the SSD issue that comes with the base model which puts it at at least $1279? Thanks!",
Here we go again MKBHD advocating Apple. But why? Since when did he started reviewing laptops?  Oh wait or shall i ask which apple product do he misses out🤔?,
Dunno why I am watching this - no way I can afford it any way,
Question will it be good for cad work for a student?,
My lenovo ideapad also have speakers where m2 just put in - Two things that apple delivers it's display and battery life.,
I appreciate the subtle call out to the new James Webb images. As always a great review.,
Stranger things season 4 reference’s?? Tik tok.,
If I were to get the m2 should I buy the 16/256 or the 8/512?,
That camera robot really pays for itself with those intros lol,
can someone buy me one please,
Clicked your video by accident and now your videos make my day,
"Everyone so worked about the intro. I watched and was like ""I mean, it's fine"". Don't get it?",
"Man, that intro!😍

As I already said, M2 Air seems like a product to upsell M1 Pro MacBooks, and makes the M1 Air even more reasonable!😂",
I pir  adobe acrobat  crack adobe adobe acrobat  crack am te viru adobe acrobat  crack  ur   adobe acrobat  crack adobe adobe acrobat  crack am pp,
The best intro of youtube,
"I kind of just… don’t understand why they make this computer. If it’s going to be a web browsing machine, why isn’t it competing with chrome books and windows PCs? Why put an M2 in it at all? Load it with an A(This year’s generation) Bionic chip, drop the price to $700-800, and make this new laptop the Macbook and put a fan in it",
We are using the same desktop wallpaper. Sweet!,
Marques' editors should get a pay raise every video he uploads.,
TouchBar all day every day,
Di you have anything else to review more interesting than boring apple products ?,
The Introoooooooo!!!!!!,
‘It only supports 1 external monitor’.. at that point i stopped the video.,
THANK GOD someone finally decided to answer the sustained performance between the two new models question!!,
Loved that you used the JWST image as wallpaper,
"So for who this laptop intended? Does it make sense over the M1, yes it's better at many things, but the M1 is good enough at those tasks, actually pretty stella, in a mobile setting the screen is OK and the extra port while charging nice to have. Im not convinced by the benchmark  drama queens of YouTube are telling me anything about  a typical use cases for such a device. Unless you go away from home to run benchmarks in a hotel room  for a living.",
"1 question for all of u will this be enough for begginer video and photo edit and coding?? 
i mean 16gb ram version",
"As someone who daily drives Windows both personally and professionally, I was planning on getting the base M2 as my second laptop, primarily for travel and my first real foray into MacOS. But after seeing a lot of reviews I'm going to pass up on it for a M1 Air. The price is ridiculous. A proper config will push me to Pro territory. Nothing wrong with the Pro but that's a lot of computing I do not need. Marques' video on the Apple price ladder comes to mind in all of this.",
I spotted the WA7 fireflies headphone amp's glass in smoke color. very nice! ~ Mike,
Intro kings,
"That transition was **chef's kiss**, kudos",
M1 is still a smooth and nice 💫,
Imagine if it was touch screen,
The intro man🔥... perfect 🙌🏼,
"Such expensive laptop is no longer entry level laptop, so the ""sustained workload"" excuse doesn't work here. There are a lot of lighter laptop which have fan, and does not thermal throttle, like lg gram, fujitsu etc.",
Nice T-shirt!,
unbox therapy channel is more better.,
Reminds me of the black slate finish on the iPhone 5 back in the day and how easily it was able to get scratched and scuffed so easily,
Imagine not even having USB-A on the right side for a mouse. Apple gon b apple.,
"I canceled my 512 GB air shipping next month and instead bought a preowned 14 inch MacBook Pro from Facebook marketplace for $1550. For $150 more yes I bought a used laptop however it is mint condition and the speakers are twice as good, screen is twice as good, and speed is almost twice as good.",
I like the James Webb picture background!!,
What about VM loads? Does it throttle?,
"The Tape on the table says a lot about the amount of efforts and planning that goes into taking just a 26 seconds Intro Shot. ""Keeps getting Better"".",
Intros of this dude put Hollywood to shame,
"Not sure ifs good for software development or i should go for  14 pro ?

Total cost for air is 2700 euros",
This video was just a blatant copy of Dave2D’s video - watch that and tell me if I am wrong,
The Intro was so damn cool,
I like the color but….. it’s dirt magnet,
small screen & expensive!,
Great review Marques but can you stop with that face mask thing? It's annoying and very CRINGE at this point! :),
"yoh, that opening video shot was siiiiick",
At this point marques should be hired to shoot peoples movies and podcast for like steven spielberg cuz his production is soo good imo,
Great analysis.,
I see that tape on the desk in the first shot! Still it’s a great sequence dude!,
"Can someone provide me with a high quality image of Marques's Laptop Wallpaper? I am aware it is one of the photos James Webb's Telescope took. I just couldn't find a HQ-enough photo to put as a wallpaper.

Thank you :)",
Amazing intro,
Absolutely loved the intro. Some Movies don't have this type of attention to detail,
wallpaper game is same as mine ;),
Where do i get that wallpaper?,
Man the intro was so nice💘,
"I'm happy with my 13 '' MBP M1, honestly spending almost the same money as a 14 '' MBP to have a decent air even if not.  Not to mention the totally useless MBP M2.  The Air has always represented the entry level for those who wanted to approach Apple on the Mac side and, instead, now costs almost as much as a Pro despite not having fans, pro motion and that brightness.",
My iPad Pro is just enough. No more need for laptops.,
"I'd like to get the nightsky Wallpaper, it's so gorgeous!!",
I'm Going To Say It. MARQUES BROWNLEE Makes The Best Intro In YouTube.,
"Love the shirt 
Great video",
"Aside from what's under the hood, it looks like the Surface Book",
Wow that Intro ,
"Ok wtf bro the first 30 seconds was better than a movie scene 😳




Edit: It is 24 seconds. Lol",
"what an intro man,  reminds me of apple event",
Except the m2 pro will throttle as well. Heavily.,
"I really do want this computer over the m1 air but I don't want to feel forced to buy the upgrades for it, I might just go for the m1 pro at that point",
"Honestly, if the MBP14 had colour options then I would have got that for my wife instead. This will do her just fine even though its £1700 for the spec I picked.",
"Great video, I was planning on getting an m2 air to replace my m1 air but bumping up to 24gb memory & sticking st 256gb as everything I do is on external ssds.

Will look at getting a 14 inch mbp instead now!",
im currently on a base model 2017 macbook air which the fans turn on when you power on so when i upgrade i dont think im going to complain about slight slow downs,
Intro 🔥,
i love ur idea using james webb telescope desktop wallpaper,
would love if you could do similar windows laptops that could actually stack up against macbooks,
Great review honest & straight to the point,
Kudos to u,
Carry a black marker pen ?,
People keep allowing apple to scam them out of their hard earned money.. I got a 2019 dell laptop that does way better than this so call brand new mac book for not even a fraction of the price that apple wants people to pay for this! It's ridiculous 🤦🏿‍♂️,
"All about the "" Pro "" is a Fan 💨😏",
the video is very interesting shot perfectly,
That Intro was 🔥🧈,
"2:58 For those who don’t know what “Several light days” means. I looked it up, marques is referring to approx 5.18e+10 Kilometers of usage.",
Intro king,
0:50 nice wallpaper link??,
"After watching all the reviews between all the you tubes, I’m considering cancelling my 512gb SSD midnight air m2 , and getting a m1 air",
Did anyone see the water droplets on the table to mark where he needed to set the laptop down😂,
nice wallpaper of Lybia,
dope intro!,
Sick intro 🙌🏾,
At $1200 it should come with 512gb default in the first place…,
"Air is not Pro, a lot of people forget about it.",
"I really like this machine, but in Europe it is just not worth it. The M1 is around 1000 Euros new at our big tech stores. The M2 costs 1450 Euros at apple. I totally get why europeans buy their macs on Vacation in the US.",
Perfekt! Thanks from Germany👍👍👍,
Your intros are dope.,
"I've been using a windows laptop all my life, I want to switch to M2 MB Air but it doesn't have a fan and chances are it'll get really hot within an hour of use, so, should I opt for M2 MB Pro 14' inch or should I buy other windows laptop instead. My use is very basic, watch youtube videos, and general browsing, usually I open over 50 chrome tabs always:)). I've been tempting to buy MacBooks for a long time now though...any suggestion will be greatly appreciated. Budget isn't a problem at all :))",
"There’s a 4th option for the fingerprint issue: if it doesn’t bother you, don’t worry about it. You don’t hear Razer users going on and on about it.",
"I'm curious if Apple would ever decide to create a Macbook SE. Maybe keep the Macbook Air M1 design in principle but tweak it in a way that they could sell it for... I dunno $699 or less and have it start competing with Chromebooks and the like (or at least the peception of a super cheap, gateway product into Mac OS).",
But the price… not so fantastic…,
It reminds me a bit of the Surface Laptop 4 in Black.,
Am using the same wallpaper...JWS amazing.,
the intros ..the intros quality,
"Intro absolutely on point as you know, but that tech, look at it. I love the new iPad design but this is next level, look how thin it is! Beautiful!",
Give a raise to the editor....that intro is sick🥶,
Intro was killer,
"Global warming, Pollution, Heat Waves, Exploitation of natural resources, Exclusive access of resources to select wealthy groups, tax provisions for business and rich to exploit, taxation on salary for middle class and poor, Growing difference in wealth division- growing gap between rich and poor, Unemployment, Inflation, GDP instability and decline, Plunging of currency value,  falling stock markets, increasing dept, International issues and political tensions, multiple governments projecting false utopia,  Weakening of multiple democratic counties, false reporting by media, distraction based journalism not highlighting the real issues that affect future generations, and ignorant masses of public!",
This is what a review should be. Other reviews just simply drop benchmarks that really don't matter for the real user.,
Huge 16 inch laptop. Lmao buddy have you ever held a 17 inch Zbook. Shouldn't be called portable imo.,
"Man!
The length of his hand!!",
"Once again a epic intro,so cool,..",
"Or 4, not really giving AF about the fingerprints",
I love the new sillykin,
Any have that wallpaper in high res?,
"Apple takes its customers for granted.. they know people will keep buying irrespective of what they have to offer.. pathetic..
I'd say Stop buying their products and force them into making something fresh.. but oh well..",
Ok so I’m not the only one who is using JWST images as a wallpaper,
Which is the thinnest laptop in the world?,
"Me: I’m trying to decide which Mac to get for portable video editing. 

Marques: This will throttle at around 5mins sustained load like video editing…. 

Great. I’ll wait for the upper end m2 chips.",
Cool intro,
Can it actually support 2 monitors natively though??,
Just love how you kept things simple and clear.,
JWST background. Nice.,
Apple is the only company that can get away with offering a throttled CPU at this price 🫤,
That intro was so smooth!!,
How is this different from an IPad Pro with keyboard,
"I believe this is a tick phase and not the tock(sp?) phase like it you mention. Similarly like the old iPhones, where the old iPhone 5 was tick and 5S is tock.  M1 is tick M1pro/max is tock.",
"Any news out there of when the macbook pro 14"" M2 will be released?",
"1:33
the first thing I noticed were Marques's Biceps 😂",
"The quality of these videos is unreal, for a small review studio the camera moves are second only to Apple",
I wonder why this guy put a JWST image on the laptop wallpaper in the thumbnail and in the video? It might be something that relates to MKBHD loving astronomy. Tell me if you noticed that,
"16gb Ram and 500gb storage should be bare minimum these days, and when you spec the air to that it's way too close to the 14"" MBP, and that laptop's screen definitely makes it worth the extra.",
Dope intro as always! 👌,
One of the most anticpated reviews!,
"IMO, this M2 MBA is for the casual user, the average user, the light user. Is there any question about that?
The casual user is nowhere near the heavy user who needs a much more powerful machine.
Too bad the price is $200 higher but the redesign and the new color options are worth the price increase.",
"OMG Just a big 👍 for that amazing intro, and just say i paused video at sec 0:31 .... hahahahhah",
I think that this is strategic given the supply issues they have had. They know with the next 4nm process the new m3 chip in this form factor will be much better. Also they hope to not have the same supply issues than as now. In which case they can start selling this form factor at 1000 dollars,
"Lol entry level ! 😪 
I will spend more and buy pro ver. 😪",
Love that shirt!,
Nice Intro guys 🫶,
I almost see every single video marquess did last 6 years . Do u ?,
"This one without a fan, CPU will burn quickly.",
the m2 macbook air is a serious flop show. go for the m2 macbook pro please. Apple had to screwup this years macbook air.,
and it cannot still play any AAA games with that price!,
The LGBTQ+ watch band? Are you super cool and also an ally? 😁😁,
Love the T shirt,
So.. who is the base model M2 Macbook Air for?,
"yesterday i went to the store AND BOY THIS LAPTOP HAS A GORGEOUS BUILD.
came back home with 14inch pro tho <3",
Another paid apple fanboy review lol,
We all got the new JSWT picture wallpaper.,
SICK INTRO ;-) ...and video also ;),
Bro I need help,
DAAMN THOSE TRAVELLING SHOTS 🤩,
wtf!?!?! BT  is still out there!?!?!??!!,
Wow that intro! I didn't wanna blink and miss something. Amazing work you guys!,
That intro was 🔥🔥🔥,
"It’s even more expensive in my country with a starting price at 1613,69$. Only for the cheapest M2 MacBook air. It’s crazy😮 But even more sad cause then i won’t buy it for that high price🫤",
This would be the perfect future proof macbook match for me if there was not the restriction on only allowing one external display (regardless if the lid is open or closed). It really annoys me because it is only done to make it not compete too much with the entry level macbook pros.,
"That intro was chefs kiss with the m2 at the end, wow nice.",
Thank you for put all the overheating „issues“ in perspective. Same with the durability problem with the midnight colour. Great video 👍🏼,
"Razer blade destroys this POS. M2 chip? Overheats? Stay with PC. Apple is inept with anything on a hard workload. Great laptop for students, awful for anyone actually trying to use it. 0 gaming. good graphic work load. AWFUL price. Get a razer blade.",
Wooow the intro,
"One lingering question, the background… Where can I download it?",
"I am a developer and use one m1 16GB Ram to media, web and software development for all the platforms, comparing with my desktop equipped with a core i9 with more ram , comparing windows running the cpu never goes above 40%, in the Intel pc the cpu goes many times up to 100%! it's crazy, and this working connected to a HDR-10 4k monitor",
"The notch is not gonna fade away if the display format changes accordingly to whats on screen, stop saying stupid things. Im still pissed at how much the notch takes away from my 12 pro max which is a horrid phone with too many bugs and crashes all the time. Apples quality has dropped so much that i just cant keep using their products. Too many stuff missing, horrible UI choices and just the way stuff is not working if its not native to apple...SHIT!",
Intros always  dope,
excellent video. 14 inch pro it is.,
"Still, too many apple related videos, its getting boring Marques!",
"Just ordered 16gb, 512 version with 10 core GPU, fingers crossed 😁",
"There are a lot of tech review channels out there, but Marques' is by far the most informative, most useful and most objective as reviews can get. They're even well filmed and edited!

No angry dude in a poorly lit room, no filler rants, no fanboy gushing, just clear, concise reviews that not only summarise the important tech specs, but also considers what type of people need it and alternatives for those who might not fit the product audience.

Thanks Marques for this review in particular - my partner's laptop is on its last legs and I was considering getting the M2 Air for her (me being a tech-geek, I'm always gunning for the latest and greatest), but your end thoughts really helped inform me which one has more value for her; gonna get the M1 Air w/RAM bump.

Keep it up mate. Your current subscription numbers is well-earned!!!",
"Good breakdown, Marques, thanks! Before the announcement of the M2 Air I was gonna get another M1 Air with 16GB RAM and give my base model to my wife. Then I was thinking of getting M2 Air base model. But now you made me think that 14"" Pro is the best value for the money.",
Oh my god the intro animation.....perfectos,
I am Still very happy with my M1 MacBook Air I got last December! It Is  my first MacBook and has been working like champ.,
Beautiful intro,
"Unlike M1 Air, the 256Gb base version doesn't cut it this time.

16Gb + 512Gb is the way to go here.",
"This mightnight color is sometimes black in different angles of this video, and that is the best snips for me. Hope they make one in black soon.",
Wow! This is such an Outstanding & Amazing Review of the Apple M2 MacBook Air. The Production & Professionalism is Movie Studio Quality. Bravo & Stunning work by you MKBHD.....😝👻👽👽👽,
The intros keep on getting better,
Did they... pay you to mention tiktok non sequitur?,
Only I love stevejobs I love apple 🍎 but u really good awesome men I like it 👍🔥🍎,
Love the Casey Neistat Tshirt,
"Yoooo that intro 🔥  Whoever did it, give the man a raise",
Please make Google pixal 6a review video I like to know about pros and cons 👍👍,
*What's up Mkbhd is here* is backkk,
Fuck that slick intro,
"I can’t wait to get this, although I love using my iPad Pro with Magic Keyboard as my mobile computer (yea I said it)",
THAT INTRO! 😯,
Can someone compare this to 12.9 iPad pro with all the accessories?,
Intro 😳,
I love that red and black core logo shirt lmao if it comes out ima buy it,
"Hey MKBHD! I'd love to hear about how macs are performing in other scenarios, than what is normally represented (like video editing and stuff related for content creation). Like I'm an engineer and I want to know if this thing is able to support my workload or not. And no, 5 minutes in this department is nothing. Regular calculations can last for hourse here. If the fanless design only allows for 5 minutes, it'd be a complete dealbreaker for me, for us, so it'd be lovely to see that. Let me know if you need help with the use casesm I can send some example calculations.",
always wonderful analysis,
Damn the intro was creative,
Daaaaaammm that Intro 😲,
Upgrading from MacBook Pro 2009 model feels very overwhelmed by now and not knowing where to go!,
Love that intro!,
0:28 CRINGE 😬,
Who has examsoft downloaded 🤣,
Soon if I have enough money I will buy  laptop like this because I'm a Netflix lover. And they said that this kind of laptop is very good for watching Netflix videos. Good luck to you guys who have purchased this kind of laptop. Yes I envy you a little 😛😁😂🤣😳,
your  intros are awesome 😍,
What about comparing against MacBook Air with intel and m1 and m2 ?,
Why TF is nobody talking about the fucking legendary daft punk helmets,
"If I spec'd a Macbook Air M2 with 512gb HD and 16gb Ram, how would it match the 14"" Macbook Pro M1 Pro with standard 512gb HD and 16gb Ram? Is the Pro worth $400 more for a slightly older processor or is the older Pro worth the extra $400 for a better all around Macbook as the 13"" is an older design and would rather avoid it? Or Maybe do a comparison on all three with same specs, whats the best buy if all are somewhat equal?",
Awesome,
Genius advice : don’t buy it,
"Hey Marques, link to the wallpaper plese?",
"Another useless Apple product, thanks Jidion",
The m2 air with 512gb ssd literally costs 1909€ in Finland. The base model is aroubd 1500. I think its too much.,
Is that a Casey Neistat shirt?! Awesome!,
"Very interesting drawing of parallels with the ""Tick-Tock"" analogy that Intel used to do with their processor lineup.",
"I did hundred of hours on one of my first macbook airs, around 12 years ago, when they were new machines. never did they throttle. that this is an issue in 2022 on much better silicone... what a step back",
"Mkbhd is just like apple. He is the best, if you don't know other reviewers exist. If don't know other companies exist, apple products are the best. 🤣",
"youtube is not paying enough money to this guy, he is still complaining that baseline mb air is too expensive for him",
Intro on another planet 👏,
the intro did not disappoint me,
Planning to get 512 GB SSD and 16 GB RAM. The most I do is some light gaming. Do I need the 10 core GPU?,
The quality of these intros rises with each video! Amazing,
Great application of game theory on Apple’s part,
Where did you get your wallpaper? Great review!,
Look at the intro frame by frame,
Link for the wallpaper please,
I need that wallpaper! anyone knows where to get it?,
Damn son. what a sweet intro.,
Never going to consider a fan less system. It has no sense.,
can someone wallpaper name or share link plz,
When you realize 80% of people skip and don't remember this part 5:08,
That intro is sick!,
I love how you used the first pictures of the JWST as your background.,
I went for starlight. I’m very much a midnight person but I think starlight will keep looking good even with fingerprints and a little port erosion. I do like the subtle color or starlight too.,
These intros are going more and more insane every time… Crazy how creative and passionate they are!,
"I dont understand mkbhd- of course you need as much as possible power from the laptop, and if this computer power is decreasing because of fan then you need macbook pro with beautiful touchbar. People, students buying this because its cheap and because this is a macbook and they have money only for one computer.",
"Take that mask off, it does nothing",
Finally. They went back to the bottom of the keyboard being part of the chassis. I hated the full plastic keyboard,
"Dude, your cold intros are becoming so so good.. I mean so goooood… Waaow.. You’re doing great work Brownlee and team…. Awesome. Outstanding. Marvellous… I wish you my best.",
If you buy the M1 MacBook Air in Britain it will cost you the same as buying a MacBook Air M2 in America.,
please give me one laptop for eduction purpose,
"So, no one will talk about Casey's tshirt in the video?",
"With the M1 Air they made a computer with an exceptional price/quality ratio. With this one they're making a very desirable product, but it comes back in the luxury territory, rather than the utilitaristic one.",
Awesome intro!!,
"Damn! 
Your intros are fire 🔥",
Love the intro!,
The background is a new picture from the James web space telescope,
I wish they made a 16” Air. 14” is too small for me.,
"People always focus on the speed of base storage, when it's life span (more important to me imo) is also half. Meaning base storage will be DEAD after half as much writing as storage 1 tier above (256 vs 512). Once your storage is dead, you'll have to buy a new MacBook.",
i want to get the wallpaper,
One illogical thing … I have my external monitor on the right but it’s plugged in on the left. Why would the location of the USB-C ports limit which side your screen is on. Just use a cable that’s longer than 60cm :),
"let me guess, not a word about the overheating?",
"Dang, gotta love that robot camera shot at the beginning there!",
"Did you notice the wallpaper on the macbook, it's one of the first images of the James Webb telescope. Just yesterday I set that as my laptop wallpaper too.",
How old are you YouTube channel is I'm curious,
wallpaper?,
"because the speakers are in that space, they will most likely get a lot of dust build up",
What an entrance shot! 👏👏,
Where can i get this wallpaper from?,
7:27 fingerprint magnet jeans.,
"bro, why are you wearing a mask?",
The intos just keep getting better !,
Sick Intro!,
How many chrome tabs can this MacBook fit in it?,
Love the Casey Neistat t-shirt!,
Looks like a Samsung...,
Broooo look at that lowest loop score and stability almost 33% dip in Air,
"The review aside, partly best camera work the team has done so far.",
"next level intro, cine movies are joke compared",
Those shoots were as good as the apple's own commercial. Wow 🤯🤯,
Is upgrading the ram to 16gb better or upgrading the storage to 512gb better. Which will make it faster?,
DOPE INTRO !! Man the way marques places the laptop on the bench with in the markers and double-checks it to see if he had set the laptop for the shot... Priceless expression..,
Thanks my friend for another fabulous video ✨,
"What is your budget for the intro?
Marques: yes",
Been a professional video editor for 20 years and there'd be no reason to upgrade the macbook air m2 past 1TB. External hard drives exist. So not realistic to add that when wanting to make it better or compare to the macbook pro 'cause it's not a realistic thing for editors.,
"Why pay extra price for mac, windows is great OS too, and intel that gives you more power for less money. But ok, if you are the one of 0.1% that you need power no mother how much it cost then I understand. But just know, everyone can build laptop that works,  it's not only apple.",
That intro was nastyyyyy 😭,
"should have started at 512 gb, memory is cheaper now...",
The use of colour in this was so so good! Just watching your  video compositions go from brilliance to brilliance is so exciting,
love the 1 second daft punk background,
The intro..... So sick,
The Intro yooooo,
That intro camera move is dope 👍👍👍,
Sounds like its unfo still not an option for Logic Pro users,
That camera motion in the beginning was sick,
That Robot Gimbal flex at the intro 😍🔥,
That intro though 🔥🔥🔥,
HOW TF DID YALL EVEN MAKE THE INTRO IM SOOO MAD,
"Good Video. Lets also consider the price point in EU / Germany. He hit this week a spot were 1USD = 1EUR. In Germany the base MacBook Air M2 comes at 1500€, with 512GB SSD and the bigger SoC and 16GB or RAM we are at 2.079€. This is a setup I would consider a premium entry level laptop and it costs 2k... This is why I would never buy a MacBook. Other companies can just provide the same specs at 1000€-1300€.",
That opening though 👌 a+,
All the stores I have seen that have these on demo display have the midnight coloured ones and they are all absolutely coated in fingerprints. I love the colour but probably wouldn’t buy it purely for the fact it will always look grubby.,
"air is and always was meant (and priced) for students, lawyers, salesmen, musicians, offices, assistants, ceos. None of these groups care about sustained load or ssd speeds.",
Thanks for speaking up about the price point! I think the M3 Air should start @ 512Gb & 16GB of ram + cost 1000$ 😃🙏🏽💻,
5:43 Overheating,
"When filming a surface at a fairly extreme angle, you should consider using something non reflective to mark where to put the whatever it is down becasue the reflection made the tape very visible.",
So thankful I bought this for school,
I know i'm not the only one that replayed that intro like 10 times before getting into the video.,
1 Like for the Intro❤️,
where is that background from 🔥🔥,
Go for XPS🤣,
0:08 SKRILLEX,
What is the performance difference between the 10 and 8 core gpu?,
"Apparently 'deceivingly' is an actual word. 
Thanks Marques.",
Screen saver used in the video?,
can anyone help me for that wallpaper,
Me and my false hope that everything would be cheaper after they removed their biggest overhead expense which is Intel.,
So buy the midnight colour but then cover it up... Okay,
.,
I watch your beatiful cinematic videos in 144p to save data👌,
"DCI-P3 70%... This machine useless, better get a PRO 14 (if you still want a MacBook). M2 is a hot processor, need in cooling system for it, for powerfull working. In default you will have a 35W charger, if you wanna 67W or higher - you should extra pay. You have no HDMI, card-reader, only 2 USB-C... MB Pro have all of it and 3 USB-C. Worst than MB Air M2 only MB PRO 13 M2. M2 have a little pros by M1, but not critical, also M1 Pro - faster than M2.

One more thing, SSD 256GB  have only half of speed 512 GB. System will be slower about 1.5 times.
If Apple got a possibility to using 24 GB on M1, then M2 have no chances in this battle, because 16GB - it's a minimal, 24GB - is optimal, 32GB - is the most powerfull. 64GB not need for MB.",
why are you randomly wearing a mask in some shots its weird,
👍,
EPIC INTRO!!,
"Headphone jack on the right?? Most headphones with a cable have it coming out of the left, and also the hand that moves the most (and can"" trip"" with the cable) is the mouse one (right). Odd design decision.",
Fake image of the space 🤣🤣🤣,
"So if I’m just using this like a glorified Chromebook do I really need to upgrade the memory or hard drive?  (I’m not interested in getting the M1 model, and I don’t want a Chromebook because I want the iMessages integratiin, and the ease of sharing photos, links, etc between my computer, phone, and iPad.",
"$1400? No, thank you.",
Apple only kept last generation in the lineup to make this seem like a good deal at this exaggerated price.,
"I don't see how d brand skin protects the MacBook Air from scratching the USB C ports, but okay",
"If it were anyone else, I’d assume a couple guys from the studio just threw on some Daft Punk helmets. But after that David Blaine episode, anything’s on the table with MKBHD 😂",
"If they get Solidworks and other engineering software to work on the MacBook without parallel, I’d get one",
"This things heats so much, it's hardly a refresh.",
"Marquis Brownle offers a M2 laptop and I still use not 2017, not 2016 or 2015, but 2013 dell is ridiculous. Poverty is difficult.",
"So Air is naturally aspirated and Pro, turbocharged 😂.",
"This new air has so many things going against it...

- Slower base model ssd
- Thermal throttling
- Expensive pricing
- Higher end specs actually thermal throttle faster because they run hotter quicker due to the increased speed
- Thermal throttles to lower speeds than M1air
- in gaming, the higher end specs actually present lower frame rates than the base model due to thermal throttling faster
- still only one monitor support
- scratches are now an issue.  Stick to silver color
- midnight is a fingerprint magnet

Apple hit it out of the park with the M1air and they rushed the m2air out.  Should have waited for 3nm before slapping on the m2 chip name.  Future improvements should definitely engineer a better heat dissipating chassis and maybe introduce a super low powered fan at least.",
That intro was sick!!! Awesome.,
"Try playing The Witcher 3 on this fucking embarrassment of a laptop for 1500$. It's a fucking fraud at this price, promoting it should be equal to terrorism",
That intro is the best I’ve ever seen.,
"The sound has some high pitch distortion, might want to look into that.",
Such a cool intro!,
Nice intro.,
Love the Casey Shirt - awesome video btw,
That intro was insane holy 🔥🔥,
Air does mít have cooling and that’s why it throttles… so if i would use an external cooling I would basically could sustain same performance as pro ?,
M2 ohhhh man blowssss the M1 away can’t keep up with all these upgrades get lost. So tired of these idiotic retardedly expensive products with less charging cables no more charging brick extension cord comes with by default anymore it’s such a disgrace I’m so sick of them cutting everything for profit. Gross.,
I have another solution for Midnight.  Embrace the marks and patina maybe take some steel wool to it with a bit of Magnus Walker style.,
that intro was just mean af,
Bro the two gusy in daft punk helms at 0:08. It's genius. Thanks a lot Marques for these awesomly made intros. I really enjoy every single one of your intros. Keep making more,
I'm watching this not because I'm interested buying it as I'm not an apple user. Just really wanna listen to him do his tech talk.,
Shout out JWST for that stunning laptop background 🔥,
"Marques got a Twitter notification that came through on the watch (6:15). I thought for sure he would have some sort of work focus or filming focus. (edit, Actually receives many notifications throughout the video.)",
Anyone gonna talk about the screenshot on the computer looks like the skyrim level up screen?,
Anyone else got the same background?,
ipad without a touch screen,
It only cost 1200$ in the USA?! In Denmark it cost 1600$,
"I read this weird article that MacBook Air M2 with 256 GB storage throttles its performance, even making it slower that M1 processor due to 1NAND memory. I don’t know if any one here has experienced it or can shed some light on it ??",
wow that M2 intro was clean,
Your Content is sooo cool bro! Hat's off to the editors.,
Yaaay.. something else I can't afford..,
*_Intro_* 🔥,
"I absolutely loved that focus on the price as I too think Apple has been really manipulative with the price of this laptop. At first it sounds so great but if you look closer it really isn't. For me for expand l example if I Spec it out like I would get it, the MacBook Pro 14"" that is equivalent is just 200€ (yes, I am from Europe) more which is obviously with it just for the screen (together with the app that allows you to bump the brightness) alone. 
One of the reasons why that is, is because of Storage (as almost all the time when it comes to apples pricing) because the M2 Air starts with 256 (which is not enough for anyone in 2022) and the M1 Pro 14"" starts with 512 which means that you need to upgrade the Storage one time already to just be level with the 14""",
For all that’s already etc etc batteries not included vibes … pls don’t .(add this well proper idea but ffs) ‘enjoying’ 😬 em working towards a more streamlining and seamless things,
I plan to go with 1TB storage on the midnight m2 MacBook air,
On the black color -- Option 4 for ownership: Don't worry and embrace the wear as patina.,
Intro was dope!,
"How is it for university students? Like I would be on Word, Excel and Safari a lot for hours on end so is it able to handle all that without reaching scorching temperatures being without a fan?",
"1200$ is expensive, it should be as all Air before start at 1000$ and the old M1 Air drop preis at 800-850$.",
The Into was got me.,
That Desktop picture on laptop from recent Nasa post🔥,
These intros are just sick! I'm 36 and I'm saying sick! Amazing production!!!,
"Couple of years back this man used to shame other brands just because they used to make 'flat box' shapes on their Laptop designs & praise Apple's because of it's whatever designs. Now, he is talking the other way. Such a man of not his words !",
Where do u get the wallpaper?,
I’m gonna stick with my M1 Air. Not compelling enough to upgrade.,
"Great review! Well balanced & sufficiently detailed.

I do have 1 question though, will the new batch of M1 Macbook Airs also now come with a single NAND chip for the base 256gb model?? If so, then basically there's no $1000 computer in Apple's entire lineup anymore.",
"Damn, he's using the same awesome JWST pic of the Carina Nebula for wallpaper as I do. Fancy that...",
we have the same desktop image.,
"So Guys I need your Help. I need a Laptop for a programming Bootcamp I will attend this year. Is the 2020 M1 sufficient or would you recommend anything Higher? By the way I live in Germany, so the Base Version of the MBA m2 costs 1499€...",
M1 Pro goes for $1800 so not worth getting this at 1400 when you can get way better mac for 400 more,
Please..out here in the EU specifically Greece it’s priced at 1599€ 😂,
I’m glad I watched this video. I was looking at the M1 at $999 vs this at $1200 and thinking why not get the newest one.,
That intro was refreshing 👌🏾👌🏾,
Intro level - Marques Brownlee and Co.,
9:26: casually has $1700 in his iTunes account,
That's a really good analysis for making purchase decisions!,
The biggest problem is Mac is the OS.,
Share those wallpapers 😲,
MKBHD's intro never disappoints!✨❤️,
In norway the m1 mba costs around 1000-1100 dollars. The m2 mba costs 1600 dollars. Not so entry level anymore…,
why would they advertise a game that couldnt run on it?,
"Thanks for the review!
I ordered the model with 256gb ssd and 16 gb ram. Will I still feel the slow ssd? Actually, I only use the laptop for office and media consumption.",
14 MacBook Pro 10% discount on Amazon - no brainier,
So dont get the base version?,
"I waited for the M2 to arrive for over a year, but they launched the 512GB version for ₹150,000 ( $1850)🥲.  Flipkart had some old stock of M1s left and got it for ₹100,000, lol. Absolutely love this machine, especially after the whole overheating saga in the M2.",
Can you charge with type c,
That intro was commercial level,
So anybody noticed the tape at the beginning where MKB placed the laptop.,
Love your reviews! Hope you can also compare the m2 air vs the m1 pro 14 both at 516gb,
"Hear me out: if you want a thin and light but a more powerful option at home, maybe some external cooling would suffice? A passive cooling block/stand or a fan cooled base + a second monitor and keyboard & mouse.
@LTT should definitely try this out!",
Now if they only made it in a larger form factor with a larger battery and screen...,
M1 16GB vs M2 8GB for video editing ?,
Buy a silver one and pack it with dbrand skin 👌,
😍,
Love how direct and easily explained this video is,
"that intro is sick. woow,  just wow. what a shot",
the intro 💯,
Actually the scratchiness of the dark MacBooks persists for years now. I have some dark MacBooks which are scratched all over the place with daily use of their usb-c ports. So I think it is not so new problem,
I don't know what's in the video but intro was man o man dope,
That intro was goood!!!,
New to your channel (youtube recommended) and loving the content and quality of it! Thanks for the valuable info!,
I’m still rocking my M1 MacBook Air (2020) for video editing at 4k and still does the job right 🫡,
"Awesome content mate, keep up the great work. where can I get that wallpapers?",
Where did you find this wallpaper?,
I wish could by this laptop 💻 😪,
Wallpaper link please,
"You can’t hold onto the 999$ price point forever bro, inflation in the last few years has been crazy. I’m surprised they could even hold the price down.",
Haven't even started the video but THAT INTROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO,
compare it with MBA M1??,
"I have to say, I love you man! And let me explain why! 

I’ve watched countless reviews on this laptop and I have not come across a single one mentioning what you are doing in terms of an upgraded M2 air vs M1 14 Pro. I’m currently looking to get an M2 air with 16GB memory and 512GB storage for normal daily use, that’s $2499 AUD here in Australia. On the other hand, the base model M1 14 Pro is currently retailing at $2999 AUD with frequent discounts being as low as $2697 AUD on Amazon Australia (atm). That small little extra cost is not a whole lot compared to the huge increase in preference you get by choosing the M1 14 Prob in my case. 

But I guess you’re right, that’s how Apple gets you to spend that extra money that you weren’t planning on doing from the beginning.. 🤷🏻‍♂️😂",
macbook pro needs that color,
SICK INTRO,
"You gotta remember though. They want to sell the air AND the pro. There has to be a difference between the two, you can’t get the ports, the screen, the brightness, in the air that the pro has, cause then the pro would be a pointless laptop. It’s good business bad customer service",
What's the wallpaper?,
Maybe they assumed they could get away with the significantly higher price due to the success of the M1,
Daymm I also made the Webb space image as my Mac wallpaper 😂😂😂,
I ain't watching any more vids with facemasks on.,
the intro is getting simpler over time,
How to install windows on that thing?,
mkbhd is now obsessed with that wallpaper,
It is pretty great video!,
Bullshit product,
where is the wallpaper i only can find low quality ones,
Slick intro!,
😳,
wow that intro si worth a million,
"This new Air is really disappointing. It offers nothing special, has thermal problems, has crappier SSD and it's iconic shape is gone to look just like a thinner MacBook Pro. Apple couldn't be lazier here.",
"Disappointing. Why didn't you or a phone next to the laptop so we can see how thin it is. 

Others didn't, was going you would.",
so basically for someone like me who does a lot of work in blender/the adobe suite…the pro would be a better option 😳,
These intros are getting sexier and sexier,
That intro!!!!,
Windows OS is the best,
That intro bro. You should make some tech series on netflix.,
"It's interesting how the initial assumption was that the 14in MBP was a ""bad deal"" compared to this, but now with the SSD, RAM and other constraints made more clear, it suddenly makes a lot more sense.",
"Oh God, you just become apple like. Making things easiest way possible! 
You will never go wrong and unsure watching your videos.  Thanks man",
What a Dope Intro......thanks team MKBHD.😎,
"I was really looking forward to this, but as if they wouldn't be expensive enough in the states, as a matter of fact they are even more expensive over in Europe. I think im gonna stick with my M1. Apple should really ask themselves why the M1 Macbook Air ended up being the most popular laptop in the world. Spoiler: the lower price-point played a huge roll.",
"lol they copied the look from the hp specter of 3 years ago, just like the rest of apple product its an overpriced piece of crap",
"Honestly, I love my wedge shaped MacBook Air m1. And I've no reason to upgrade. I love apple silicone. It does not disappoint",
"Hey Marques, 3:09 in the video you say that the M2 MacBook uses thunderbolt 3. Doesn't the M2 Mac use thunderbolt 4?",
500 nits display come on man an s22 ultra clocks it at 1750 nits 😂😂😂,
Holy smokes intro 🪩,
What do you think about the thermal mod?,
Thanks for talking about the slower Swap issue. It just makes this laptop a lot more expensive than we were expecting.,
please explaine how apple deskview  work,
I'm just curious to know who started this talk about what Apple's MacBook Air is intended for? It cost over $1.2k and I'm supposed to look at the laptop like it's an average android tablet?! Is this part of Apple's marketing genius or what exactly is going on here?,
Dude all of your videos are eye candy,
All good but I was expecting atleast 90hz,
"“Included a Midnight color Apple sticker…”
And no one ever slightly cared, even once…",
"Maybe you should get a thermal camera to see specifically where it heats, and for future tech like phones etc 🤷",
M1 was better than this M2.,
"As for the speaker quality, are these speakers better than the M1/M2 MacBook Pro w/ Touchbar at least? The speakers on that laptop is surprisingly great I’d love if this MAcBook Air speaker matched up to that at least",
Happy to see the mask marks on your face. Stay safe in this covid surge time..,
"As always, sick intro",
04:45 Would paint scratching be a problem on a space grey?,
who tf is stupid enough to buy this thing?,
1.5k for laptop without a fan.. people are crazy,
THE INTRO AHHHH,
The *@!x/-Gz BIG Useless Notch is back Again 🙄👎🏻,
Got GF M1 air for $850 from Apple Refurbishe . You can easily find it cheaper than that too.,
The opening scene 🔥,
Scratches add character. It’s like ripped jeans. Embrace the scratches. They’re just cosmetic.,
"🥺🥺 oh Lord, I need a Mac as such",
intro of the video is absolutely fancy,
It's worthless. It has that black square at the top of the screen.,
"that intro had no business going that hard marques, good job lads!",
Noticed the tape marker at the start of the video 😅,
"I'm a Software and Data Engineer, and I use a lot of local and heavy-duty tools in my everyday. So last year I switched to an M1 MacBook Air M1. My main struggle at the beginning, was that since I never used a Mac before, and I needed to upgrade my laptop, was ""do I go for the 8GB or 16GB RAM model?"" so, for my current budget at that moment I decided to go for the 8GB Model with 256GB SSD, because I use another monitor so I needed the extra cash for an adapter. So, I've been working with that base M1 MacBook Air model for more than a year, and I can tell you, for the amount of work that I handle, I think is the best laptop I ever had, period, no questions asked. I typically use Parallels, and a lot of Python libraries, also lots of web pages, but the laptop rarely gets slow, and since is fanless it is quiet as hell. I use Clean My Mac very often, and typically I follow the best practices to have the battery life at its best, overall its been almost 18 months with that model and it is the best laptop experience I ever had. My only complain with that model would be that it is a bit small the screen, but that's not like a big deal.

I think buying this M2 model for someone who already owns an M1 MacBook Air, would be nonsense. I've seen the benchmarks and it is not a huge improvement, but it does cost 200 USD more.

Unless someone is upgrading from an older Intel laptop, or Intel Mac, this might be the one to go. 

I even compared my M1 Air, against a 4000 USD dollar Intel Mac, and it is almost the double faster.",
"very weird that he didn't mention the real issue here, that 8gb ram. it simply isn't enough anymore and really the m2 macbook air/pro should ship with 16gb base while the m1 pro/max should be 32gb base. 

i needed a new macbook and i was 100% willing to get the m2 macbook pro but not at 8gb. going up to 16gb bumps the price up A LOT and at that point i just bought the 14'' m1 pro because i was spending a ton of money either way",
Pleaaaseee do an xps 13 plus video,
NAND chip cheapos.,
Give information of huwai ear birds,
Great review of the M2 Mac book air. Of all the YouTubers reviews this is the one that's 👍,
*That intro 🔥*,
6:12 a fan cooled system is a must have for me 🥰😍.,
your intro🔥🔥🔥,
"better than Apple's intro. Yes, 14"" MacBook pro makes sense",
1:34 yup he deffo plays bball😅,
It’s the original space gray,
"@ 5:00 - or No 4}... spray the case with car plan clear polymer coating ,as used on car bodies to get a tough clear shine coat...did that with my Razer blade laptop...a great improvment on fingerprints.",
that into though!,
that's my wallpaper..,
"@marquess Brownlee - kudos for owning master shots. My question is, are you getting into scripted that you need to understand actor blocking for your camera work? Regardless, if you dig that book I got a bunch of really cool suggestions for you. Another great reguew as always.",
this video sucked,
m1 or m2,
One of the best intros ever!,
Because of the slow ssd situation its a flop item! Stupid apple made the most popular laptop’s most popular model a dumbstar 💔,
"Who else noticed the background photo from the macbook air, it's the image from the James Webb Space Telescope.",
The intro is absolutely brilliant ! 🤘,
This might sound like a ridiculous talking point but I'm genuinely curious why you shoot clips with a mask on while being alone in the shot. IMO it's not a fashion statement to sport a mask. i don't see a purpose to continue to do this.,
"Everything Apple does is intentional. This laptop was priced / specked out to nudge you in the direction to grab the Pros. Hits you with that thought process of, “uk what? I might as well just get the Pro”  well done Apple",
man! that notch is to ugly to consider even buying the macbook air. all for a non framing of a display we have this ugly notch. i see why ives quit.,
That opening M2 transition was so clean. 🔥,
The intro bro 🔥😊,
Damn in my country is almost 1600$. That is ridiculous.,
That Intro was so incredibly done. The M shifts at right a little before going to the left and that kind of detail makes this the best tech channel on youtube.,
"Apple wants people to buy the MacBook 14 M1 Max for 2000 USD. In India, that makes more sense because spending 1.95 lakh INR for M1 Max is a better value than buying not even half the performance of New Air. New M1 Air with 512GB SSD costs 1.5 lakh INR. For an additional 45000 INR, we also get 16 GB RAM and 512 GB SSD in the base model, and superior sound quality with SD card slot too.
For India, need a lightweight Mac, stick to the base model of Mac Air M1.
Need high performance, go with the M1 Max 14-inch base model.",
Got a used m1 MBP 16gb ram 512 ssd for under 1k. Love this thing,
"Marques saying ""we"" a lot in his videos now, as the team keeps growing. What a class act.",
"Im new to coding and programming. And I wonder If this model is good for that, 512gb ssd base model?",
"Everyone: Can we just get Black?

Apple: Here’s gray that’s a couple shades off of the silver and a dark blue that’s just far enough off of black to be noticeable.",
Good stuff...again.,
Nice Wallpaper,
"Brandon, that is one hell of an intro. Splendid.",
Is it better to upgrade the ram or the ssd storage ?,
M2 MacBook Air 🔥,
Hey you copied my wallpaper 😹,
"I assume you can still charge it with usb-c if you want/need to, right?",
"It's a shame this is missing mini LED and higher refresh rate. This was the upgrade I was most looking out for, better buy M1 Air, IMO.",
is apple going to release an M2 macbook pro 14 and 16 inch?,
after having my macbook pro for about 3 years now I have the paint issue near my charging ports.,
You got the same background as my phone. Awesome picture from the new telescope.,
That intro .. !!!,
That intro transition tho👌,
So…there should be a model down for $800? Or is that an iPad,
I'm a programming student and plan on buying an m1 air. Should I upgrade the ram to 16gb or the ssd . Both are a  200 dollar upgrade but I don't know which one would make my overall experience smoother. Any advice ?,
Apple should hire your team for making those fire intros.,
MKBHD intro just hits different,
"The intro should be on apple Chanel , it's sooooo amazing and clean 🔥🔥🔥🔥",
"Love the new nebula picture captured by JWT man, I don't know if that was on purpose but well done!",
"Wow 2 million within 21 hrs, you look amazing in the field.",
So essentially this laptop is an overpriced web browser,
Noice intro :),
"Does he have more or different people now working with him, his p oduction had gone up quite a lot. Badass intro broll",
I left MBA for a Thinkpad carbon X1 and never looked back.,
It’s hard to justify the MBA optimally configured as the MBP 14” is on sale now for $1799 at Best Buy 🤷‍♂️,
what's the watch face you are using on your apple watch?,
"I was anticipating a bad ass intro music, and I got it 😍😍😍",
Funny how you put water on that table to mark the alignment for the edit. :D,
"LOVE the wallpaper
(its a pic of the Carina nebula from the JWST telescope by NASA)",
Caralho que intro foda,
"New drinking game. Everytime Marques says ""still in the lineup"" you drink ;)",
What an intro 😍,
"Getting to compromise after paying premium price has become a thing for apple.
If your thing is normal use then just buy a 700-800 dollar laptop. Save some bucks. Don't buy this.",
We can all agree that we have the same wallpaper on our machines 😀,
"Hi there, there is a scam going on, someone impersonating Marques on Instagram. Somehow they have hacked this youtube account and they claim to be his giveaways platform. They send you to Telegram and from there they tell you you are the winner of a laptop so you have to send them money for the delivery. Just to warn you all and to Marques too. I followed the whole process to see how it worked so I could report it afterward. Take care, you all!",
That intro!,
can you still charge the device from the usb-c ports? because some of us invested in monitors that do so. Thanks,
I'll stick to my ThinkPads with manjaro,
"My usage is pretty basic with emails, surfing and MS office. Should I go for MacBook Air M1?",
"The pro 13 still stands to look like a professional laptop, it has a decent vibe and this thing now looks fancy",
"So besides basic computing, would anyone say doing Video editing work is worth it on the baseline m1 over the baseline m2? Id say for something most likely less the 10 minutes of 4k video? I see that most people say that the m1 is the more solid choice but I was watching elsewhere that as long as the m2 didn't start to throttle it outperformed the m1. Would just like some opinions for a future purchase.",
"I want to buy the base model of macbook air m2 with 8 core cpu and gpu
8gb unified memory 
512gb SSD
Will it sustain a moderate work flow without getting heated?
And is it good to choose this at its current price compared to macbook air m1 ?",
Worried about it dying due to excess heat. Please keep in check the extreme heat of any laptop.,
thats some apple level ad intro,
"If you're not replaying the intro several times, before watching the video, you're watching a MKBHD video the wrong way...",
Thanks for the review!,
I ordered the M2 air 16/512 spec (midnight) which is $1739 with student discount in my country. I chose this over the M1 because that is 2 years old already and I really like the new design. It was within my budget anyways so I just went for it.,
The sicccest intro ever 🥵,
This has to be the coolest intro I've seen. Love it.,
You got me on the James Webb telescope background 🤩🤩,
lmao looks like a huawei product from 7 years agi,
No way I'm buying the m2 air at that price point. Like you said just grab a 14 pro which has recently been discounted to 1700 in multiple places.,
"In Norway, this laptop with 512 SSD and 16GB of RAM is just $100 away from 14” MBP base spec (512, 16, M1 Pro), whats up with that?? There is no point of getting Air with that kind of pricing… 🤷‍♂️",
high quality as always <3,
if some oyou didn't get the refrence back in the dya intel had Tick–tock production model creating a new arcturcutre every 2 years with the mid cycle being an update refresh similar to the old S in iphones,
I just bought the m1 a few months ago… I’m feeling sad,
Am I the only one that wants those desktop wallpapers?,
Nice,
Loveeeeeeeee theee Introooo,
I think u... pgrade to 512GB/16GB .. this price is still acceptable for 5 years of work.,
Kick ass intro🔥🔥🔥,
if I have a 2020/ 2021 idk MacBook Pro m1 should I get this one? is it better battery?,
"Or, 4.. just don't worry about it ;-)",
"So Macbook ""Air"" doesnt have a fan? Ironic.",
"Such a nice looking laptop, Shame it’s average in everything else",
I rewatched that intro more than the number of ports this M2 macbook air has,
"crazy how few comments talked about the intro until i continued with the rest of the video
marques truly takes things to the next level!",
wow that m2 intro 🤙🤙,
"marques as a fan I really wanna point out that I'm missing your MID video music
like while saying a point  or making a cool thing in the middle
cause it gets boring 3-4 after that SUPER COOL OUT OF THE WORLD intro, and you starting out. mid 5 mins are tough to keep with 😂😂🤷‍♂🤷‍♂ idk might be alone so take lightly if this comes up at all",
Where can I find that wallpaper please,
Bet you that entry M1 will soon go up in price as well due to inflation anyhow…,
Thanks Marques Brownee for your excellent and detailed reviews!!!,
"“And deceivingly expensive” 100% agree. I ordered a M2 MB air a few days ago and it came out to $1300 and some change after a $210 gift card, and college student discount which was an extra $100 off. Was it worth it? Maybe…",
I am curious if you dont mind wearing band and watches on the same arm :D,
"Okay, so… you are discussing American prices. And basically what you are saying is 1199 is too high, specially if you consider the fact that you can find an M1 for under 1k easily. Well, I’m Italian. The European price is an astonishing 1529€ for the 256 SSD. Even with the student discount, it still is 1414 while a brand new M1 starts at a more affordable and realistic 1114, with the student pricing. My question is, who is this Air for? Students don’t need a better chip and the M2 is barely better than the M1 in whatever a student or normal person would do. I mean, even for light content creating work the M1 is fine as ever. Is it for people who need to work with it? Doubt that. As everyone is saying, the SSD is so slow you have to upgrade, but upgrading means you are getting close to a price tag that screams “just buy a Pro”. Is the inflation and global crisis catching up to Apple too? I only see one reason for someone to buy this device: the brand new design. But hear me out: if you have never had a McBook, like me for example, you don’t need a new design. If you are upgrading from an older McBook, getting this M2 could seem like a deal, but it really isn’t unless you have the budget for it. If you need a laptop for work, you just get a Pro. In any case, this M2 will sell solely for the form factor and the new design. The chip is an upgrade that most common users won’t even notice and you can get a refurbished M1 McBookPro for the same price of this Air. I just don’t get it, but maybe it’s my fault.",
Marques out here doing damage control,
Love the wallpaper!,
Mkbhd working on JWeb ST review ? Marques be like : I have been using this telescope for the last 5 months .,
"For 90% of consumers, the air is more than enough.",
One could say it’s the darkest shade of midnight blue,
That Intro move is slick dude!!!,
"Apple knew that now most people gonna choose M1 rather than M2. So they silently increased the price of M1, in India. So disappointing, I was thinking of buying M1 air after new release.",
"You forgot Mac had the ""G"" series silicon before intel. I'm showing my age..",
"Alright, this might just have to be my favorite intro yet. Jesus it was AMAZING",
"Nice product, would be nicer if it didn't have MacOS. Design and performance are top notch (no pun intended), but as a previous Mac and iPad owner, I much prefer my Windows laptop. Great review as usual!",
Can u share link to your ‘cosmos’ wallpaper? It looks cool ✨,
is the price including tax ?,
"If anyone in the uk is curious, $1,199 in gbp is just shy of a grand, but apple in the uk is selling the base model for £1,249 which is just over $1,500. That doesn't seem great for us in th uk.

Edit: especially when the £1 is meant to be worth more then $1",
These intros keep getting better and better! 🔥,
Casey Merch On Point!,
ima stick with my MacBook Pro 2020 for awhile lmao,
this guy is jealous of himself,
"This should have been a $1299 computer, and the base model should have been the same but come with 512gb storage.",
"The new M2 MacBook looks and feels so excellent, definitely considering this to be my daily my driver as my laptop for school purposes and entertainment as well, thanks Marques for the review",
I love how you use the capture of James Webb space telescope as a wallpaper.,
Nice intro 👌🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👏🏿👍🏿,
Apple needs to hire mkbhd for advertising,
Cool intro 👌👍,
what about using it with a good laptop cooler??,
My god! That dope intro!!!,
Speakers better in the M1 and I can’t get used to that notch Uggh.  I don’t use MagSafe anymore I’d rather have had at least one port on the other side .  All good still a great computer but I will keep my M1 Air.,
NOTCH ON A LAPTOP IS UGLY…,
Your intos man❤️,
"Apple could learn a thing or two about how to anodise aluminium from B&O who has always oxidized paint deep into the aluminium so scratches will just have the same color.. as long as they are not brutally deep, bit it is expensive to do properly",
Thanks so much for this review! Now i gotta tell my mom to reconsider the 14 inch for my highschool laptop lmao.,
The notch is inexcusable. SUPER ugly.,
"The camera work in these vids are next level, it's so good",
"Thanks for the review! I’ll wait for M3 air then. They built in inflation into M2 air, only sucker will buy it.",
intro 🔥,
Watching in M1 Mac Air ✌🏻,
"snap, that M2 keyboard intro,  👏🏾🔥",
"2:58 “Several light days in the row”
Physics/Eng students had to rewind.",
Please Can I have It?,
"people just want apple at this point, not giving a fuck about performance.",
The reason why gear matters is that some shots can only be made by a robotic arm,
That intro omfg,
Wow camera moves!!!!,
Dude as always the intro is Super Littt🔥🔥🔥,
"I have a 2020 intel 13in pro. I think I’m going to stick with that for a while, it’s still a solid machine and I can run bootcamp still which helps for work.",
"Just got the M2 Air base model. The slower SSD and less RAM is OK for me, since I will only be doing basic things like browse websites, use Word, Powerpoints, that kinda stuff.",
Where can I find a high res image of the background?,
Intro 🤌🏻,
Boyy that intro,
"I’m entering college next month and can’t decide between this air and the 14” pro because the price is within $300 with similar specs and has a better display and is just in all more powerful but the air is lighter , more portable , thinner and still nice for school",
Aah... the intros!!,
yeah ok vecna with the tick tock and the clock,
Bro the robotic arm intro shot made me go “ohhhhhhh shiiiiiit!” So good,
4. Accept it.,
The pingpong playing in the background of the Intro - just 👌🏻,
Final cut on airs works perfectly so it is for that acrually,
sweet machine but way too pricey for a basic 512gb spec.,
"Either don't get the midnight or get it and cover it with a Dbrand skin.... 🤣 I mean I love dbrand skins, but if I have to cover it right away then, it doesnt really matter what color I get I suppose. Still probably going to get for the midnight 😂",
Apple is just getting worse..... no thanks. What a shite laptop for the price,
What happened to posting videos on Nebula  ?,
"Thanks for all ✌️✌️✌️ 
I love you too all ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️
Best luck 💪💪💪💪💪
Best wishes 🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝🤝",
"""If you miss the ports enough, you start to scratch the paint""

Apple probably: just don't miss, duh",
"Hey Marques - which is the better machine - 256GB SSD + 8GB RAM or 512GB SSD + 16GB RAM. Simple personal laptop use (surfing, netflix etc) and want to keep it for a solid 5-6 years.",
Can it run crysis thou?,
2025: M3 Macbook Air starting at $1399,
that intro... 🥹,
Its performance is disappointing.,
that intro was dope,
God damn that intro though,
"I really liked the M1 MacBook air, and I should've gotten one when they were new but I couldn't afford one. I think they're still available on Apple's website, so that's a plus. But, now I'm not sure what would be the better buy. I specced both out for 16 gb of ram and 512 gb of storage, and the M1 is $1,399 USD and the M2 is $1,599 USD. Which do y'all think is a better buy?",
"4th option for the Midnight color, don't care about fingerprints because it doesn't affect the use of the laptop.",
The fingerprint problem can be solved with a tactical removal of the fingers.,
Love the James Webb picture,
Need that link to the wallpaper,
I think a refurbished 14inch m1 pro MacBook pro ($1800) is the way to go..it will have 16/512 ..and 120 hz mini led display,
It isn’t painted blue lol. It’s a powder coat on the aluminium,
"Whaaaaaaaaaaaattttt, that intro was soooo crazyyy!!!",
Or 4. Just don’t care that your laptop is scratched.,
We’ve the same wallpapers :P,
hey thanks for including other creators like Dave in your reviews. Interesting input from others helps to get a bigger picture! Keep it up :),
Take off the damn mask 🤡,
Best Intro´s EEVER..!,
0:08 🔥🔥,
"My question is how much longer would a pro last me, as in years of use",
I really just want to see the return of the 12” MacBook…,
1:34 smooth,
Where did he get the wallpaper ?,
I need that Carina Nebula wall paper. Damn that's gorgeous. I can't seem to download the high quality image though. Can someone help?,
"I know Apple has to keep bringing new styles and refreshing old ones, but the black one looks terrible to me. They just look too much like those old Pentium III IBM Lenovo Thinkpads. 

To me it's as bad as the 80s & 90s beige beasts.",
"Hmm it's such a hard decision. I ordered the m1 air 512/16gb but the same spec for this model is only 220$ extra. But 220$ is money and it's not functional differences but comfortable ones. Plus at that point another 320$~ gets the m1 pro. But then another 200$ is the 10 core pro.

Which one do I get ?
The m2 air with those specs is nice but I'll not have a laptop for 14 days during my finals. I was thinking of buying a refurbished and returning it during that duration?
230$ seems like a good price to pay for a comfier laptop for the next 3-4 years.",
Incredible appreciate the video! Need a new laptop for logic pro x & adobe apps any recommendations?,
"Tock would be with no freaking notch and 14 inch display, like this is jist knock knock on our wallet",
"The way I see it, this is a 2000 USD Chromebook without the ports. Way to go...",
It looks so good😩,
"I’m stunned by this intro. Great transitions, awesome!",
"I am a fan of the old design: the tapering shape was extremely ergonomic.
This shape will once again pierce into your wrists 🤦‍♀️",
dbrand = dislike on your video. Every. Time.,
You are amazing Marques! I always enjoy your videos. Thank you so much,
🔥 intro just killing it ❤️,
Can we appreciate the James Webbs Telescope’s photo of space as the wallpaper?,
"8 GB ram in 2022 is inadequate even for web browsing, it's crazy that people are still willing to buy unupgradable machines with 8 gigs for $1500",
my dell g15 with rtx looks stupid in front of this😭,
Where can I get this wallpaper?,
That intro 🙀,
"The M2 Macbook Air's single ssd of 256B in my opinion is not that big of a deal. Seems that no other people share the same mindset as me but I'll explain. So, you run your drive benchmarks and yes, the speed is halved, this I understand. But, swapping memory, moving files (not photos/videos), etc, the size of those files are insignificant. For example, if you move a software project folder, it has thousands of small files in it, then it won't matter if the ssd is capable of writing 3GB/s or 1.5GB/s, because the moving files are too small in size. Or when swapping memory, I do not think that flushing some pages from RAM will cause the ssd to take a substantial hit to notice the difference. Yes, when you try to copy that big video file from your external drive to your mac, you will get 2 minutes instead of 1 (almost double), but how much of a problem is that? Point is, 90% of drive operations the mac will be doing will be bunch of small-size files which will not impact the performance of a top of the line ssd.

Nice video Marques, been waiting for it! Thanks!",
Damn I liked the intro,
Oh I wish I was rich but if I ever have the money I'll go to asus g14 but still wanna experinece a mac once in a whike you know? Lol,
"Absolutely preferred previous wedge shape. Held both machines in person. Air now feels it has lost its Air-ness. On paper, new Air at its thickest point is thinner, but overall despite what reviewers like Marquez convey the new squared shape feels thicker—my perception. New shape feels like a design regression. Not a compliment.

Good that they bought back MagSafe, bad they didn’t bring back SD Card—like 2017 MBA. Stop port-gimping the MBA. Teacher, conference speaker or amateur photographer who prefer thin and light should not need dongles to plug stuff in. MBP should have twice the USB4 count of the Air, but Air should not be missing basic ports. FACTS.",
MacBook Air M2 base model or MacBook Air M1 with an upgraded 16 GB of ram? They end up being the same price as well.,
Why just Apple laptops? will be interesting to see other brands and options :/,
more than a refresh to meeee,
Always appreciated how well Apple can milk their customers because they don't know any better...,
Cool shirt... with those ray ban glasses....,
Your intros are the best!,
"buy a midnight color, but worry smudge hence put on sticker skin😐",
How bad is it single ssd compare to double ssd if you just doing school stuff? Planning to buy the 256gb for the next 4-5 years,
MacBook Air (Gold) >>>>>> Anything else,
The one we've been waiting for.,
It brings heat wave to the Europe 🔥🔥,
"It is a very efficient laptop if you do not do very demanding tasks, but the price is excessive and unaffordable for the common user, I am from Mexico City and the price is almost double that in the USA.
I haven't been able to buy a macbook pro since 2012. :(",
Pretty sick intro shot 👀❤️🙌,
time is so fast,
The scratching is why I go with silver. Absolutely hated how space gray would show silver beneath.,
I love that he uses one of the wallpaper pictures taken from JWST,
*insert generic comment about the intro here*,
Man !!! The intro is so sick... i paused the video & came here to appritiate it first. 🙌🔥,
"512gb should be the base for laptops, it's 2022.",
This is my dream laptop 😌,
"Is that the Skyrim perk screen as the desktop background ?
Thought we wouldn't notice. But we did.",
Hey MKBHD the intro was beautiful. Hat's off the the MKBHD team...I want to describe more but sorry I don't have any words...😶😶,
"I wonder how their screen holds up this time around. I bought macbook pro last year and the screen died 10 months into use, browsing net and writing uni stuff, no creative editing etc.
I later found out Apple is in several lawsuits because of their faulty macbook pro/air M1. I hope after they fix it it won't die on me again.",
"7:45 Is that amazing, or just what you deserve for that price ? I wouldn't expect any less from a 1500€ arm machine, let alone a 1500€ pc. Btw in europe this macbook air starts at 1500 for the 256 gig model, that is outrageous. My laptop/pc for 1250 is sitting with 2TB right now, and i could easily upgrade it to 12TB and more (3 drives) Comes with a 3070 and amd 9 5900HX, it better at everything but battery life. If you don't like golden showers, don't buy from Apple",
How would I connect this to a monitor via HDMI?,
"Personally, the notch is still extremely visible and affect a lot of apps behavior on full screen mode",
"Bro, sick intro 💥",
That intro🔥🔥,
The intro tho,
That is some awesome camera work,
that intro tho!,
"Can I get a link for that wallpaper, please Marques",
Extremely SICK intro holy shit🔥,
💎,
what a intro...,
we want a behind the scene on the studio channel of the intro,
"I want a laptop for programming, should i consider macbook air M2?",
Apple-like intros 🥵 Superbly done. Tip of the hat.,
Come 16 GB ram and 512 GB should be the base spec for $1200!!!,
Watching this on my M1 MacBook Air,
which laptop do you use,
"Is this a good laptop for college, economy",
"For “benchmark” scores (which mean nothing to typical buyers), could you maybe test using some excel and/or light common games like Minecraft? I think that would be more tangible…",
What an amazing intro 👌👌👌,
"Im not a hater and no disrespect here but its a macbook, creative/media editing is only where it really shines. 

Once Intel/AMD catch up with arm based processing and windows becomes more arm based you will start to see apple suffer on the desktop/laptop market and will need to do extreme things to try to get ahead (for the i phones it will be fine).

The only people that will buy this are professionals (at the moment) or fanboys (idiots), the cost for this silicone is just retarded and ur paying a premium for stupidity.",
So good for code eh ?,
MKBHD has better-thinking knowledge than Apple. 0:21  and 1:05 and 1:06 (wallpaper) and 3:30 (focus to speakers),
looks like a zenbook,
That is a cleeeean intro!,
"I remember a couple of years ago when 500 buck laptops were midrange and people who spent over 1k on laptops were rich.
Nowadays every kid who has never worked runs around with one of these",
I use an XPS 13 2018 Model & I can say that the design of that laptop is still better for me than this Air,
"No more cheap performance with these MacBooks. Back to using Ryzen thin&lights. Especially since the Ryzen 6000 series are pretty much as power efficient in some tasks as the M1. I got myself a Ryzen 7 6800H thin&light called Redmibook Pro 15 and it's both really powerful when you have it ""docked"" and also very power efficient when you're browsing and programming on the go. I got it for $1044 off AliExpress with shipping, and it comes with 16GB RAM, a 512GB SSD, and a great 400 nit 3200x2000 screen at 90Hz. The keyboard is fantastic too, and so is the form-factor, since the laptop pretty much parodies the MacBook Pro.",
Those james webb telescope pictures thoughh 👀🔭,
thats such a dope intro,
You should watch the European prices . It starts at 1500 euro. Which is 300 euro more than the m1.,
Oh yeah those bench marks sound ligit 5 mins 👍,
link to the wallpaper of the MacBook Air?,
The new M2 pricing just makes the M1 an even better deal than it already was (especially considering that you can get the M1 Air in many places at a discounted price for like $750-900).,
Love the intro. Love the Carina Nebula background pic from JWST.,
Wallpaper link used in this M2 please,
"Would be nice to see a comparison against M2 Air and the new Ryzen 6800U based OLED Zenbook S 13. At 1500$ it has a fantastic 2880x1800 16:10 OLED screen, 1 TB SSD, 16 GB of LPDDR5-6400 memory, 8 core / 16 thread CPU, 3.8 TFLOP iGPU and weights only 1.08kg. M2 Air with similar config costs 700$ more. Would be an interesting battle.",
The M2 is junk.,
The Apple Mac N CheeseBook has always been the same thing with little upgrade and for some reason people in jerking off the this piece of unreliable shit off to this laptop dude just custom built your damn PC it cheaper and 100% more better.,
Holy fuck that intro was so good.,
"Hi ! 
First ! Nice with the Casey neistat shirt!! Loved it ! 
Second, about MacBook … well, the problem is … the material, the MacBook, it’s still a battery to recharge,  a battery that will age through time, a battery to change within 2 or 3 years, 
It’s surely an amazing piece of work but now that I’ve ruined my first 2015 MacBook Pro, and that the main problem is the battery ..
I don’t know … 
I guess my issues are within a big picture 
Also I don’t truly like 15 inch MacBook so I guess I need to think about that",
You could have used Hubble image for M1 and the Webb image for M2 to show the transition 😊,
add the best oled screen with no notche and I would seriously consider it. the asus vivobook pro x14 seem to be just better at this price,
*thunderbolt 4,
It's mark azz brownie,
Why is no one asking about that Tee? Where can I get that? I love glasses.,
"For light video editing, like vlog style stuff this laptop seems to be amazing",
That intro was next level!,
Thank you for bringing up the SSD issue unlike a lot of other Apple channels.,
"NGL my M1 Air is still terrific. But man, this is just such a great upgrade......",
Cheapskates. Should have anodized it not painted. Could do multiple colors with better durability.,
"Man these intros, they just keep getting better everyday.",
1:17 nice wallpaper on you macbook air!!,
Looks a bit like the original huawei matebook pro,
The intros just keep getting better! :),
its really good they put the speaker on top under screen like that because when u turn music on it bounce on screen makes it louder and more focused than normal speaker. great job Apple.,
Do you really need to put a mask on to record a computer review alone? 😂,
Mask slave.,
"The Midnight paintjob is absolutelt beautiful but scratches so easily, like the Slate iPhone 5.",
"They should rename then to MacBook Air, MacBook and MacBook Pro (with the pro cpu)",
MKBHD is the Apple of reviewers. Fantastic as always. This video was well worth the wait.,
"NICE INTRO!!!
And I use that JWST picture too 😁",
"been charging my m1 pro 16 once a week due to the optimized power. its really great for travelling when you need it to go a long while , changes the way you view portable work machine",
where do i can get these wallpaper?,
Fantastic transition on the keyboard 🤤,
Strangers things 😂😂🔥,
Apple after 10 years - “bringing back the ‘iconic’ wedge shaped design”,
"You talked about pricing, and I am wondering if it is a good deal if you can get education pricing with the currently going on sale/promotion where you get ($150 gift card). So overall, the original price of $1399(M2 + 512gb ssd upgrade) - $100(education pricing) - $150(current sale) of $1150 for M2 with 512gb a good deal?",
Totally unnecessary piece of kit. It’s either M1 Max for video or M1 for everyone else…,
THAT ESTABLISHING SHOT THOUGH,
"Why did they not put rubber around the USB-C ports and stuff and just left it bare aluminum, that's why it starches.",

Testing for durability? Bro JerryRig would have it covered 😃,
That intro was more than a refresh,
Dekh rahe ho Binod kaise colour ko kharab bol ke debrand ka skin becha ja raha hai,
"Nice review but @MKBHD there’s always the entry level with minimum spec for that Mac diehard but who doesn’t or even will ever need all the power & storage but wants to keep up with every next new Mac. They’d prolly never use 50% of it’s power but they need it. The student,everyday office person or simply a home user for web browsing,studies,research and social media. The lowest tier does it for them. Apple knows this too well👌🏽",
Finally! I've been waiting for this vid for so long!,
OMG 😳 this Keyboard M2 intro was of another level :) perfect idea …,
color cable is the greatest update since lion os,
Mac really needs an entry level model like iphone SE or 11 . Here in India everyone is accustomed to Windows so we chose windows laptops even when going high end as we don’t know what mac os feels like.,
Since it doesn't have a fan heat sync thats a MAJOR draw back for me 😭😞,
Daaaamn that intro was sickkkkk,
"Your video quality is i guess better than an Apple ad , really awesome video.",
Sick intro Marques 👏🏽👏🏽👏🏽,
ong thats how i am right now,
Where did you get your wellpaper?,
Yaaasss James Webb photos,
I agree saving a bit longer to get the $1499 Air :). In Space Grey!!!,

Considering that I would like to keep this MacBook for at least 5-6 years.",
Most expensive shit,
"Thank you, that was a very helpful review.",
The new opening song reminds me of some oldschool Ratatat.,
"Silver all the way, shows up the least when it comes to wear and tear.",
That intro ❤️,
"11:12 
So, I would suggust..considering it",
I also kept the same wallpaper man ....nebbula,
Intro was really dope. Robot camera movement is epic,
What’s the point of the speed and design if you can’t even change that dumb pink os wallpaper…,
"When the 1st thing come to your mind of ""Tick-Tock"" is ex-Intel CPU development strat rather than an app, you realise you're old",

Wooooow... that intro bro....... felt like i was watching one of those Apple product launches.,
16/256 or 8/512 m2 mba,
So its over priced then yeah should be £1000 or better spec for the current price. No upgrade for me now,
"Oh my god, I love MKBHD's video editing Jesus Christ",
Does this have a better display than m1 pro macbook,
We know you are apple fan boy. Me to own apple products. But you need to be unbiased with millions of subscriber of yours. This m2 chip and around everything of it is ripoff. Buy m1 or wait for m3.,
i dont understand the ssd issue. how does upgrading to 512 solve it?,
What an intro!!!,
"Fan Less, overpriced, slim piece of 256GB hotlap throttle machine. Peace ✌️",
Dope Intro!!!!,
This looks really cool but I can't justify it since I have a tablet,
Lol. I have the same wallpaper on my MacBook.,
did everyone really miss dave 2d's comment?,
"PLEASE tell us, how you did the smooth camera movement from 0:09 - 0:24!!",
What a way to start the video ! Appreciated…,
I love how you now start your videos 👍,
These intros are crazy bro,
These days i am watching your videos just for the intro!!,
That intro is sick🔥🔥🔥,
I wonder if there's some relation between dark blue on laptops and fingerprints. Because another dark blue laptop (Galaxy Book Flex) also gets a lot of fingerprints. interesting. It's a very nice looking colour.,
Intro 💯,
So… this laptop is the typical second part of a movie going wrong. I personally hate the design for the Air now. If I wanted that design I would go for the pro.,
Dude! Such a great review!,
Intro is just awesome.,
i see the tape on the table,
The intro is 🔥,
Is the ever going to be a larger Macbook Air? Perhaps 16” form factor?,
"Girls: How rich you are?
Me: 1:34",
Why they need that notch 😐😐😐,

The intro 🤯,
Ok I need help. I have been a Samsung and android user my whole life. I just switched everything Apple. Which laptop is better The MacBook Air M2 or the MacBook Pro 13 M2. I don’t want to make the wrong choice. People said the Air don’t have a fan so it’s slow,
The photos from the JWST is a nice touch Marques! Also we have a new word for the dictionary 'Fingerprintiest' !,
"Thank you!  
Love your reviews! So much common sense 
Just got mine and I love it!",

Man these intros are getting stupid good,
"shiiiit, that intro!",
"my recent experience with macbook pro m1 chip: 
on testing, destroys the field on single core but really hopeless on multicore. 
I use the macbook with two browsers with numbers of tabs and few other application open.  it works perfectly fine at the start but if you don't shut down and put it on sleep mode and reuses it, it is slow as hell, applications takes ages to open, fan starts to sound like an jet engine and it is all hot. it is not just one workstation, tried on colleague's same incident. what is going on ?",
"""But speaking of workflow and horsepower"" That's a good switch around😅",
Imagine being in a situation where your jealous of a light laptop whist carrying one of the most expensive laptops money can buy,
Intro was fire. So well done. I watched it at least 5 times. (2 of which at 0.25 speed),
Intro 💥💯,
Great work! Thank you for doing all thes comparisons.,

Loved the intro!!!!!,
No one can convince me that this is Apple it's definitely a dell product!!!!!!!!!!!,
Very good point of naming it the $1500 laptop.  Straight and clear for all potential buyers!!,

2022 and people still buy Apple crap? lol,
why is mkbhd making better intros than apple making their ads😭😭,
That m2 intro is obsoletely awesome,
"Even at consumer level use, you just can’t justify the price. Yes it looks dope but that’s about it? In comparison with last years model? Paint scratches are one of my gripes so I usually got the plain silver one. My 10yr old 13”mbp has one scratch. 🤷🏾

The hard drive thing is just disappointing, especially at this price point. Cook’s formula is just based on concession and accept flaws. Understandable that Ive is moving away from all of that.",
I find it funny that the MacBook Air is the one without a fan,
Your spelling of each word is crisp and good  voice bro😃,
If Apple allowed this thing to support 2 monitors it'd be a no brainer for me. Frustrating.,
Carina for the wallpaper! Nice. Love the black Air - very nice.,
"8:19 Lol, for 30 chrome tabs 😅",
Coding? You mean editing text? 😅,
That intro was hella tight. How did you do that camera swivel?!,
screen is awsome!,
I wish apple would make it so game developers can work around m1.,
I'm wondering how this fanless laptop handles 40°C and plus heat now that global warming kicking ?,

Niiice,
"1) macbook air is meant for light workload not for professionals, videos creators, gamers etc… 
2) if used as intended, it wont throttle 
3) would you notice the ssd speed difference when writing a doc or browsing the web or watching a video? No.
4) pro models have faster ssds and fans therefore, you can go for those if you believe are suitable for your intended use of the laptop…

Enjoyed this review. Good one Marques.,
i think going for my M1 a month ago was the right call,
I like the previous design better. Looked thinner,
Reminds me of Pixelbook Go for some reason.,
"Yea let’s buy a $2K MacBook just so it can overheat when I open safari. Apple makes the worst laptops. 
They overheat while inside the house A/C on 60°, I have frozen bag of peas under my laptop and yet I open one tab and it starts heating up. I’m done with apple. I no longer buy products from them",
Ok I love how he acknowledges that 30 Chrome tabs open and 15 apps running in the background is the regular use case. A lot of channels treat anything more than 3 chrome tabs open as something above the regular use case.,
Don't Buy Apple Products.,
lol I’m so glad sold my mac book pro m1 for a asus tuff gaming laptop 🤣it really opened my eyes on what I was missing out 🤦🏻‍♂️,
is it just me? or does all of his videos seem like they were edited by Apple themselves. 11/10 editing every single time!,
"My M1 Macbook Pro lags when i have a lot of Chrome tabs opened, lol...",
"probably worth noting that upgrading the storage isn't the same as buying an SSD, instead it's buying a better binned chip. Definitely worth it in the long run.",
Thanks for pointing out the absurd prices!! 🙏🙏🙏,
"As soon as AutoCAD can run on the M1/M2, I’m switching to a Mac.",
JWST gorgeous,
It‘s an honest review. Thank you.,
Remember we still have October for new MacBooks so that could change the way of how the m2 works,
I used to tell people that m1 allows apple to make the hardware cheaper. Boy was I wrong. Turns out designing your own chip is expensive,
love the cg,
intro was cool.,
Amazing intro!!,
The intro shot  is everything,
0:30 that was nebula wallpaper recently shot by jwst.. right ?,
"Tick M1 😂
Tock M2 😂😂",
Great video on the MB M2. You made a couple of interesting points about the laptop. I do agree it should only be used for having 30 web pages open.,
I'm still getting the dark blue color...,
What a intro!!! Dope!!!,
Lately MKBHD Intros are next level. They should have a separate page just for those,
"Never mind the review, that intro was Apple marketing level-kind of quality.",
short form video website... hahaha sounds soooo cool,

"Good ""real world"" review. I already have a  M1 Air (256g/16g memory). It's still responsive but the M2 Air doesn't seem much of an upgrade.  I take a lot of photos and make slide shows and perhaps an M1/M2 pro may be more of a worthy upgrade?",
Can't even buy the charger for this expensive metal box.,
"The 256GB M2 MacBook Air still has SSD speeds of around 1450MB/s, that is not slow!",
That intro though...!,
Is a MacBook Pro too big impractical and too heavy for everyday university life or is it the perfect laptop if you have the money for it?,
That’s a whole lot of talk and he never said if it can hold up to playing music and sending off invoices at the same time..!,
The wallpaper😳,
Nice JWST background you have there.,
That intro ☝🏼✨🫠,
Thanks MK. Your videos just keep being better and better 🥰,
i want that wallpaper pls ....!,

sleek intro ✌🏽🙂,
Bruh... The intros just keep getting better,
That intro!! 🥰 M2,
5 mins is a lot of stamina ngl iykyk...,
If you add thermal pads on the heatsink so it connects to chassis it actually outperforms m2 MacBook pro,
"Could see the tape marking where the laptop should go! Lol
Dope intro, though!",
I just MBP14 that seemed most plausible,
My MacBook Pro is a late 2013 model. Still runs like a charm.,
Intro is on fire....,
@5:10 really really funny !!,
"Would some tell me if the macbook air is good for coding ( web , client devops , big data and server )",
"Oh no! The base model isn’t that good because of that SSD? don’t say that or a “kind of chemical magician” will trow you out of the discussion!
Oh, my fault…you have 15mln subscribers and maybe, but i could be wrong, you know better what your saying.
Great job!",
For that price I would demand a touchscreen.,
"7:10
Gaming?",
"""HEY CASSSEEEEEEY!""",
Add the fact that the prices are even higher outside of the USA. Here in The Netherlands it’s €2000 when u want 16ram and 512ssd. Very very close to the m1 MBPro,
"512 model is $2,000 here in Norway which makes this a total no go…",
"I was considering the M2 Air; the mag-safe, the 20% up in Brightness, the new design (perhaps), but the 256 Mem already felt a bit tight and the increasing likelihood of throttling as photo / video files get bigger and tasks more complicated the calculation changes dramatically. If I need to up the Mem to 500 the price goes up £1,500, which makes the M2 50% more the the M1, and that makes me reconsider the whole proposition. A very useful vid, thank U.",
Give it up for the opening!! 👏🏾👏🏾👏🏾,
0:05 tape on table for laptop exact placement else it could be a david fincher shot with 100 takes.,
"But for $2,499 you can get
-10-Core CPU
-16-Core GPU
-16GB Unified Memory
-512GB SSD Storage¹
MacBook Pro M1 which is faster than the base M2 chip 
IDK BUT I'M JUST SAYIN",
"Anyone buying a 256GB SSD is not working it hard enough in the first place to make it suck for them. 

Pleple keep forgetting for a large number of enterprise and business users, not YouTubers will not fill the 256GB even. Fleet machines use cloud storage. Most of my clients barely break 100GB and run multi-million dollar companies. Apple and all manufactures for that matter make several tiers for this ecaxt reason. If you need power, you are making the loo to buy a pro machine for the largest chunk of users.",
But its blue 🤮wonder is Apple hires incompetent hypsters or incompetent trolls… this keeps happening,
"I got one right at launch, I received a dud. Overheated, speakers distorted at full volume, and battery didn't last. I returned it, and stuck with my M1 Air. Never again.",
It's expensive because it's finally flat and squared. I hate their bot upward sharpens on the last one.,
Literally the exact same chip just clocked a little higher,
Holy shot that intro was 🔥,
Mask game like its 2019,
I’ve been Waiting with very little patience for this video I’m so excited that you posted this. I really enjoy your perspective. And I also will definitely be buying the 14 inch Mac book. But for my wife this looks like it’ll work perfectly,
Nice to see that MKBHD and I have similar tastes in wallpaper.,
So macbook air actually has no fans for air cooling? 😂,
Number 4; Don’t be anal about fingerprints.,
"Brother you are the biggest shill on YouTube. Twice as slow for the base model? Watch Max Tech's latest video and you'll see with light multitasking (extremely light), it can be 6 to 8 times as slow. What is it you do exactly with all that time and money you get from 15 mil subs, if it isn't actually testing and reviewing major product launches like this properly? Also the way you talked about it sounded like it is faster than the M1, which we already know is not always the case, and the base model can be significantly slower. Thanks for nothing.",
Still trash for this price,
*Apple really mad at MKBHD right now for breaking the code on their price tricks and giving his viewers other options*,
I have the same JWST wallpaper!,
what an opening omg!,
1500 bucks you can get a good laptop with 16 GB of ram and dedicated graphic card.. this is just a piece of garbage.,
"Ok so, $1200 device should be used for 20 chrome tabs and light media consumption!
Even if I'm drunk, I'm not buying that bullshit. I'd rather buy a bulky heavy gaming laptop which offeres much more than this.
I think people should boycott Apple products.",
Dope intro bro,
you had marks on the table so you can know where to sit and where to place the laptop? :D,
8:13: M1 Ultra Mac Studio 🔥🔥🔥,
"Still rocking my 2012 13"" Macbook Air, just the battery is shot",
0:00 those not-so-subtle tape markers on the table... XD,
Do you know why the Inflation in US is so High in USA now because people still buying expensive things like this M2 MacBook Air with this price U$1199 and don´t need.,
Great review and I especially loved the intro!,
Can we pick up fingerprints from the laptop and use them on the touch ID to unlock it?,
"See, I don't like this review, because it's not a review for the target audience. You go on talking about creative workflows, but who buys a MacBook Air for creative workflows? To me the target audience for this would be executives who spend most of their day in an Excel spreadsheet or creating presentations. It could be school or college kids who use it for doing project work with some light video editing if any.
Yeah sure the single NAND chip sucks, but do you really notice it outside of benchmarking it? If you've only got 256GB of storage, you're not going to be copying large files. I think in regular everyday usage, it'll be just fine.",
damn that intro,
"""substained loads""",
What laptop is thinner and lighter that isnt a tablet format? I would love to find one.,
What is the difference between the M1 Macbook air and M2 MacBook Air,
mah man supporting the 5 min gang,
What an intro! It was Apple-like!,
thumbnail wallpaper?,
"""5 mins is a long load"".... my pc rendering an animation for 3 weeks ....",
Hey dude,
"I notice from apples site, that they are yet to put the M2 into the IPad .... is this because at cheaper than the base air it may make you question why you need one or the other????",
"""It's also deceivingly expensive""

That's Apple in a sentence",
"Love from India bro❤️, would you mind gifting one of these, I am college student I need, but I can't afford it 😅",
"I have been a Windows user my entire life and have never been able to get comfortable when using Mac OS or have ever really wanted a MacBook of any kind. That said, this is probably the first Apple product that has made me feel like I may want to switch over, at least for my computer. Still not in the market right now, but if Apple continues along this trajectory, they're certainly going to make my decision a lot more challenging.",
So does this mean that UE5 won't play well on M2 MacBook Air?,
Basically get the M1 Air 512gb for $800-$1000,
This dude always makes me laugh. 😄,
"I’d go with tip # 3 -take really really good care of it 💻 lol 😅 

we agree Sir",
"I'm not up on the Apple stuff, but my bro was on about his latest one a few months ago. He said it took seconds to process some finalised graphics work, rather than minutes!",
"I get excited everytime when Apple launch their products, specially their laptops, and come to MKBHD for knowing specs, instead of knowing that these are way far away from my family budget.
Let me make a wish, ""Hey God do any miracle that MKBHD giveaway a laptop"".",
Damn the color. Love it.,
Amazing camera work!,
I’d like a tutorial of how to do those intros 😮,
Intro💥,
the desktop picture just slaps 🔥❤‍🔥,
It's absolutely criminal of Apple to charge $200 for a 512GB SSD. 🤬 The base model is already $200 more.  I can only imagine the margins on the spec'd out models.,
"The black polycarbonate MacBook from years ago was also a fingerprint magnet, but I saw lots of them out and about.   I tell anyone not to get 256GB anyway, because they'll have it for about 4 or 5 years and invariably fill up the drive.",
"Or 4, do like I do anddon't give a shit about finger prints and a bit of wear on the ports.",
the intros have become sooo extra... i love it!,
let me hold that wallpaer,
"Hey bro, we used the same wallpaper Carina Nebula😄",
Your intros are unmatched,
How do you do these amazing intros?!  That is so dope!!!,
The intro was actually really good!,
Can't even critise apple when the make the same old shxt and yet you can't help yourself when other manufacturers try new things. I want to know how many apple shares you bought mfkr,
"unless you're a real pro/spender lol if you need a macbook, save up for an M1 that is hopefully on sale and you'll be set for quite a while.",
Exremely happy to see you using music from 20syl again,
What about upgrading to 16GB RAM and keeping the 256GB SSD? Would that solve the problem or is upgrading to 512GB SSD the only solution regardless of the RAM?,
"This Air M2 is unfortunately ""no buy"" thing... We were waiting so long for this device and now... Pfff, just disappointing, BUT it was to expect, because Apple doesn't made a big fail in the last 4-5 years. The last one was the keyboard... Sorry, the only possible right decision is to skip. :(",
"Why they can’t add fan in the air and charges some more money . Such a stupid thought that if you want more performances get with fan one mac if you don’t take without fan , when some giving you money make simple noh give easy choice 😒",
Marques I like your t-shirt! Casey likes it too I’m sure! Took me to a memory lane! Haha,
Fab video :),
Intel wedge shape 2020 Air? M2 Macbook Pro on the webcam comparison? Whats happening to your video MKBHD?,
Killed that intro bro!!,
The photographer of that wallpaper.... He's Permanently damaged 🥲 R.I.P JAMES....,
The last 2 minutes of the video helped me to decide ! I ordered a M1 Air today 🤩😊,
LCD screen 60hz is stuff from the past. Saving the OLED screens for future updates in sure.,
Amaxing intro,
You should probably give me away this,
overpriced tarsh,
"I sold my iPad Pro with Magic keyboard as it cost more than an entry level MBA M1, and the MBA has been great and more useful than an iPad and nice to use. I use this for work sometimes as well as after hours and it hasn't missed a beat. I think the 8GB with 256GB storage is fine for many people. Mind you my main computer is still Windows, a desktop as the cost of ownership is so low. Good review but yes, I think the basic MBA M2 or M1 will do the job for most people.",
"hey kbhd, apparently what caught my eye is the wrist band that you are wearing. looks like a digital one with complete screen around. Would you shed some light?",
"I basically keep seeing the same end result, ‘this is great, but if you’re looking at this you should really get the M1 version of it or should get the MBP instead’.",
That intro... <3,
"The M2 already got me excited for the M3, especially since the use case for many who want to buy Airs require some of the addons more than features from initial specs. What the M2 offers now will pave the way and clear some of the hurdles for the next generation, both in terms of price and new technology.",
I’m wondering if MKBHD is on DBrand payroll. 😂,
"This is so odd that half of his videos revolve around Apple products. 50% 

I really believe he needs to make more variety",
"Why is this dude wearing mask indoors while working? Mask is supposed to protect you from transmission in closed spaces with people, not a fashion statement. He’s changed.",
Garbage 256gb,
"Why is it that the use cases of tech reviewers are always limited to creative stuff and gaming? I mean, you make content about tech, might as well showcase all the major use cases of it. Your audience is not limited to video editors.",
That intro was beautiful,
"Apple ditched intel, still increases price and then further comes with 8GB RAM and 256GB of ""PCIe 3 Storage"" in *2022* meanwhile the industry is readying the transition to PCIe 5.0 - how the Fuck does this make any sense?

If Johny Ive was outcasted for lacking Steve Jobs to balance his obsessiveness, then Tim Cook should resign for the same reason of sheer obsession for profit margins where there's no Steve Jobs to oversee. Even the Asus ROG Phone has a Vapour Chamber and had a fan - this is a frickin laptop!",
"Please don't do anything light/dark in the video (graphs). When I watch it at night, very quick change of brightness is hitting hard on my eyes.",
But Marques… you didn’t tell us which colour YOU would choose?,
who noticed the the space wallpaper on the laptop taken by james webb space telescope...?😅😅,
"Hey Marques, you talk a lot of ""we"". Who is ""we""? I mean the channel is all about you, right?",
Waking up to this in my feed... feels like Christmas morning.,
$1500 is really too much to ask for 15 chrome tabs!,
The intro was dope,
JWST first images as wallpaper✅👍,
Had to watch the intro four or five times. Cool stuff 😎,
I have this wallpaper,
Wow your video quality is INSANE,
"Wow, WEBB background!",
"I think all reviews have been done in a way comparing it to m1 instead of giving us all the info as new MacBook owners. The upgraded screen, the powerful headphone Jax, the great keyboard, the zero fan at this performance, what other windows device even comes close to this performance at this price? 

would love to see a review for the m2 MacBook Air that isn't comparing it to m1.",
I was waiting for this video for a while.,
would rather just get a used 14 inch pro for like 1700,
That intro was so dope,
The M2 MacBook Air is so most laptop laptop I have ever seen I love it,
Bruh I’m tired of reviews talking about rendering videos. Nobody is doing that and especially on the Air.,
Thanks~! I am now an iWitness to this.,
That intro though ! Dope,
"Man, your intros these days are next level!!",
A segment of customer would want to use it for entertainment purpose. In that case how does this stand against M1,
I’m thinking about buying the M2 MacBook Air but I’m also on a budget if I wanted to more or less resolve the issues should I either upgrade the storage to 512gb or the Ram to 16gb? Thanks for the help 😊,
Warning : no tik tok were harm in the vidio 🤣🤣🤣🤣,
Loving Casey Neistat's Tshirt !!,
Giving a thumbs up for all of the JWST images being used as desktop backgrounds!,
option number 4: don't care about fingerprints and minuscule scratches,
Compressing .xz archives  or compiling a kernel (benchmark ideas for your next sustained CPU load test)… very real world scenarios if you deep with backups or tinker with compiling your own kernels.,
Cool shirt! 🤓👍🛹📹🗽,
I saw the tape in the first scene 😋 one of the best cinematography in entire YouTube world ❤️❤️❤️,
so no one is gonna talk about that wallpaper?🌚... link please if any one have it,
30 chrome tabs :DDD,
MKBHD shilling apple and basically telling me to get a mbp. sick,
What a cool T-shirt he's wearing,
marquees — not only the quality of your review is excellent — your video cuts and edits are dope! thx for a classic review! ✨,
WHAT AN INTRO 🥵,
"I’m pretty disappointed with the M1, it runs sluggish with just normal work usage. Forget it.",
You do the commercial better than apple,
"5:10 option 4 - use it, get it scratched and scuffed and call it ""character"".",
Those introoooooos woaaah <3<3<3,
Nice Camtransition from MacBook Front to Topview of the Keys. Kinda like Appleproductionmadness😄and you gotta nice wallpaper on your Desktop - i put that as my iPhone Wallpaperdesign,
"Completely unrelated to the M2 Air... but man, sometimes you folks pick absolute neck-snappers for your intro music. This one had me in a full stank face. *20syl is DOPE. Loving the content as always!",
Wallpaper link?,
Honestly if you got the MacBook Air M2 to with the main objective of high-performance tasks you’re a fool to start with,
Cheers!!! we got the same wallpaper.,
Intro!!!,
Oh god your intros 😍. YOU ARE MAGIC,
"APPPLLLLEEEEEEEE BRING A GREEN ONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Macbook air is not the choice for game dev?
I personally wouldn´t buy a 8gb ram notebook in 2022.  I would recommend 16gb ram and around 512gb ssd at least 256gb but that could be for everyday use tight depending on how do you use it.",
I miss the dust spot 😂,
"GOOD TO KNOW
💥THANKS 💥",
"Biggest flaw I really don't get, why the headphone jack is at the back on the right side and not at the front left side?!?",
Will this work fine if I'm making a 30 - 40 min long video on iMovie? Or should I just get the smaller Pro M2?,
"In my area, a high spec 3070 laptop is cheaper than base M2 MacBook Air",
我剛好也用了同樣的桌布😂,
"If you use Apple's ecosystem, you gotta carry:
1. Lightning cable and charger for iPhone
2. Type cable for iPad
3. Magsafe charger for MacBook
4. Their proprietary converter for the watch

The most informative/useful MacBook Air M2 review I’ve seen lately,
If I were to buy should I buy m2 MacBook Air or m1 Mac Pro 16 inches?,
So it has no fan?,
that intro. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐,
I’m looking to buy a new MacBook for college so should I just buy the baseline m1 or this m2?,
i hope it can video edit well for a $1400 machine,
Wallpaper from the old macbook air in the beginning?,
If you consider this then you should just spend a day in nature and then go buy an asus zephyrus g15 and live out your days as a happy person,
Your wrist band is missing 1.8,
"Hello ,,, प्लीज मेरी हेल्प कर दो ।।। 🙏🙏",
9:00 - all I needed to know. Will wait for the next version of the MBA.,
That intro though,
Is the screen the same as the old m1. I have issues with the Retina display peeling on the M1. Will this do the same?,
Is there a reason as to why MK doesn’t do EV reviews. With the amount of EVs coming out you’d think that would be ample content for him. Hope he didn’t sell out to elon lol,
"Im curious about whether music production in Logic Pro X is considered a sustained load, would anyone has an answer for me? :)",

Been waiting for this,
Review by a Jedi,
"what a sick intro, love it",
"You are by far, by far, by far the BEST reviewer out there. You always deliver. ✌🏼",
witch one.. air m2 or mac book pro m1 2020???!!!,
thnx i am looking for a laptop for my sister,
بالتوفيق,
It's quite expensive for an entry MacBook.,
I was considering buying for traveling mostly because my 16” is not travel material in my opinion. It’s heavy! But at the same time I feel you when you say Apple should started with at least 512gb ssd and more memory without going so high up with the price.  And I wish there was a full white one including the keyboard!,
Btw is that a Casey Neistat T-Shirt?,
"So you just said that this laptop is not designed for heavy use since it is an Air, and then you complain about the entry-level version's SSD being half the speed? The video otherwise was great, amazing intro by the way, but this point really put me off.",
"Simply: M2 lineup is not as worthy the M1 Lineup was.
Final Verdict: Close your eyes and go for M1 Pro Macbook Pro",
"I 'feel' your creativity bro. 
You were born to do this stuff.
(I know,  you weren't but still....)✌️",
"Everyone cursing m2 air but u r recommending this . If I wanna buy m2 air for 1500 , y can’t I go with m1 pro , bulsit",
can anyone share the wallpaper he’s using? in full res?,
"What I liked is that this review didn't stick to the general benchmark trope and actually talked about when the performance hits would be observable. Secondly, goes without saying that it was very well presented. The quality just seems to be going up with every video. 

What I am surprised with, and it's something that's more of general trend with reviews of Apple products, is how easy reviewers go on Apple products. We're looking at a 1200$ laptop which downgrades the storage speed from its previous generation while upping the price and without declaring anything in fine print about this change to the users. So much so that most users are strongly recommended to upgrade to a 1500$ model by default. I don't see reviewers being as forgiving for a similar product by another manufacturer.",
Waiting for apple to launch $100 gloves to counter the fingerprint smudge issues,
That intro. That intro. That intro!!!!! Just beautiful.,
I'll make the pointing bit the first and last time.,
I think apple will start selling base model macbook air M1 with a single SSD module itself as it did with not including chargers in the older model of iphones ( or ) include two ssd modules base m2 macbooks when the chip shortage is sorted,
"Scratched or not, all these electronic devices get old, useless and start eating dust after 5 years. So, don't worry too much about trying to protect them.",
That was such a sick intro.,
i need that background!!! ASAP,
Can we just take a moment and appreciate that intro! 🔥,
I had to rewind the video to watch the intro again. 👍🏻,
overheating design,
Marques ! My guy is getting even better with them vids 🔥,
"I love how he snuck an old MBP in there at at 2:50  , casually throwing shade",
"Thank you! Awesome review. I still don’t know if I’ll buy an M2 MacBook Air (16GB, 1To) or a 14” MacBook Pro with the same RAM and SSD. I’m
upgrading from an old Mac Mini. I’m a musician, using Logic Pro (a lot…) and Final Cut (not every day). Your review is helping me, thank you again.",
Awesome intro 🔥🔥,
The battery is so impressive 💯✌️❤️,
Currently waiting on mine to ship. I custom-configured it with 512GB SSD and 16 RAM. 😬,
I feel like the 512G/16G would be the sweet spot for long term great performance machine.,
I won't spend 1499€ for base model laptop. That's to much. It not even properly cooled. 🤣,
for those who were thinking to buy m1/m2 chip for development purpose.. don't,
Your intros are getting better and better day by day,
Can you share these wallpapers? 🙏🏽,
intro was tooooooooooo goood,
Casey Shirt!! <3,
"beautiful. laptop mostly is for some work or task, soo bigger specifications Mac would be good investment. + if your really going to do some serious work, then you need to be inside the laptop, i mean inside everything. then after work, the reality.",
"I kinda like when black laptops get scratched around the ports. 

Old Razer blades have this tough look after some year of good use kinda like a patina.",
the daft punk callback in the intro was what i needed today,
U should make more vedeos on smartphones that don't come to the us,
Is it better to get the M2 MacBook Air 8GB RAM with 512 GB storage OR M2 MacBook Air 16GB RAM with 256 GB storage?,
"Better off going for the M1 Air with 16gb ram , upgraded ssd and the 8 core.",
"The world market has changed. We can’t get components at the same price and quantities anymore. This is the same argument of “why can’t we fly from coast to coast for $100” well the reason is it’s thousands of miles and cost fuel to do so. Please, how can you expect this incredible tech at the same price EVERY year?? I don’t have a Mac but I respect the product they make…….",
Can you do some Windows laptop reviews too?! I need to buy one for my higher studies pretty soon.,
That into is next level 🔝,
"You could argue that the Air being so ultra portable should have the best thermals and any kinks ironed out. 

This is gonna sell on refresh alone.. cause if performance and value is what you’re after.. you’re getting the M1 Air.",
Dope intro,
So all of us have the same wallpaper these days!,
"The limitation of only one external Monitor is unfortunate. 
Also feel like I had to upgrade to 16GB RAM and 512GB SSD, and like you said, then the 14"" MBpro becomes the better deal",
8GB shared RAM is unacceptable at this time imo,
they killed black... why did they make midnight a thing,
Why can’t they get with the program and make the screen touchscreen,
"When the colour and fingerprints are the main critique besides common concerns with all laptops, you know it's good. The one I've been waiting for.",
china is a fascist totalitarian regime ! any one who uses or advertise this app is part of it !,
That shirt! 🕶,
Nice Neistat shirt💪,
what an intro...,
In my country the base m1 is 1199€ and the m2 is 1599€,
Hello! Nice to be there !,
"Basically , This is a pretty good laptop but it generally makes more sense financially to just get the 1000$ m1 macbook pro that consistently goes on sell for 850$ considering it performs incredibly similar to the m2 air to the point that the average consumer wouldnt even notice and if you are ok with spending the 1500$ on the m2 air you might as well drop another 500 and get the pro which is gonna perform much better.",
Is the t shirt your brand ????,
1650 dollar for base version in Sweden.,
256 GB entry level storage in Macbook is the 64 GB entry storage in Iphones 🫣,
respect to you for having jwst photo as your wallpaper!!!,
"Awesome video! Our situation in Europe is still bunkers. The dollar/euro price is almost even, at the moment. But Apple still doesn't change their price model for European market... For the base model MacBook Air you pay : 1519,- euro in The Netherlands compared to 1199 in the US.......... not fair! They should make adjustments.",
Is that a black MacBook?,
I bought one of the M1s because I thought  they might get rid of them. I'm sure this is a lovely laptop but I can't see the need for it.,
"MK, gotta say that the intro is siiiick. Keep em coming",
Sick intro tho!,
Merci Marques,
Marques the into is sooooo sick!!,
"how much apple paid you for this? lol, better to buy Pro version.",
"Which of these two is better for a university use (take notes, watching videos, using excel and other stuff)?:
-MBA with 512 of SSD and 8gb of RAM
- MBA with 256 gb of SSD (with the storage issue) and 16 go of RAM
Considering that I would like to keep this MacBook for at least 5-6 years",
can you play WoW with full resolution on it?,
i could honestly watch that intro on a loop all day,
Aaa James Webb wallpaper 🔥,
Wallpaper link ?,
"I really wish they kept the wedge shape. It was the single best laptop design I've ever seen. Other than that, perfect.",
Been waiting for this. All those other people on here can’t sway me like MKBHD,
can anyone please  tell me this video aspect ratio.,
"I'm surprised to see Apple short change storage speeds on the base model, especially after seeing no expense was spared on processing capabilities for the entry level M1. I ran into slow storage issues in my Surface Pro 2017 a few years ago and told myself not to go through that painful experience again. 

Looking at how all reviews are bringing up this point, Apple might reconsider this issue in the 2023 M2 MacBook Air? It will also be time for the M1 MacBook Air to fade away from the lineup.",
Excellent review. The best I have seen since the new MacBook Air M2 came out. The fact this little laptop could render videos shows it can handle day-to-day workflows. I have a version spec'ed out and I am looking forward to its delivery.  Yes it was little pricey and I normally buy MacBook Pro's but when I look at how I use laptops I think this hits a sweet spot for me.,
the tab s8 ultra is the better option at that price goofy ahh big iPhone,
Jesus Christ your production value is absolutely insane,
Nothing can beat your intro bro👏,
I'm prolly gonna keep my m1 MacBook air. Have no problems with it and it renders videos of DaVinci Resolve faster than my PC which has a RTX 2060 super!!,
"With that spec in Sweden it is 1988,89. Apple has a weird conversion and adds a lot, 500 dollar extra for same model. This was never a budget laptop. Many times when price increased abroad we got lucky and got somewhat of a closer price but this laptop is already 2000. The MacBook Pro is 2400",
Worst design of the Year in Laptop 👎🏻,
Love the wallpaper <3,
"Im really considering either getting this with 512gb and 16gb of ram or the M1 Pro (the best M1 Pro) 16gb ram MacBook Pro 14"". And I'm really leaning towards the MacBook Pro 14"". Im upgrading from the M1 Air (which has been great, but my lil brother needs a new PC so he'll buy my M1 for cheap), and I think the Pro 14"" would be a way better upgrade.",
Daft Punk 0:08,
INTRO THOOOOO 🔥🔥🔥,
Intro 🫠🫠,
Problem is it has the shitty macos 🤮,
Mkbhd working on JWeb ST review ? Marques be like : I have been using this telescope for the last 5 months,
How is the sound on FaceTime?  I use it to teach singing.,
There are so many praise comments that I've to wonder something's up,
"Get Dbrand to make a clear MagSafe / USB-C port skin that covers around them, kinda like those things you put on a car bonnet to stop stone chips 👍🏻🙂",
Love how the Air doesn't have airflow,
I think Apple cheated consumer... for making business.,
At this pricepoint it is just not worth it with 8gb ram and 256gb ssd. But it seems to be done to make the step up to the entry Macbook Pro look more appealing. Such a same because the previous Macbook Air is/was a great deal,
That into doe,
"I'm glad it has issues, because i just decided on a used m1 air",
"That really sounds like a no-man's laptop for me. 8GB RAM should not be considered by anyone really (SWAP memory and SSD wear is a thing) and the 256 SSD is a no-go because it's slower, so you're looking at an at least 1600+$ machine (2000 in Europe) for marginally better performance than the M1? I was looking forward to it, but no way!",
"With my Series 4 Apple Watch, the same kind of paint scratching is happening around the speaker holes. I can see the silver underneath the space gray.",
In Germay the 512GB starts at 1850€ is way beyond an entry level laptop sadly.,
“Fingerprintiest 💻 “😅😅,
That clean intro on the m key ❤️,
Gre  adobe acrobat  crack adobe adobe acrobat  crack am t,
Coding also involves compiling every now and then..so that is also using all cores for a while,
"the fact that there is nothing bad to say this computer except that it's not as fast as Mac Pro for 30000 USD is amazing,",
"Wow that intro... Awesome✌️✌️

Apple production level",
M1 still a better buy for now.  Maybe m3 will be best and apple make it more affordable.  Your still ridiculous with costs.,
The notch is a no go,
You guys still do the muzzle thing or you are disgusted by your inferior workers who do not work until 5 in the morning?,
"00:00 the tape marks, legendary 🤍",
Intro. So. Dope. Geez man,
in Europe (italy) starts at 1529 euro. so it's pointless. with 512 and 16gb it's 2000... just get a 14 for that price,
Yo id love to know the name of the clock band thing on your arm!😄,
"Fantastic that even in super edited intros there is some sign of homemade, like the tape on the desk that to keeps the MacBook allined",
where to get that wallpaper?,
Intro on Repeat 🔥,
Crazy intro!!!,
"that intro tho
Sheeesh",
the fingerprintiest!,
Fully spec here I come,
People need to start criticizing Apple more for their poor aluminum/paint treatment. This didn't used to happen.,
Thanks god I bought M1 for $850 six months ago! cuz its better than this $1200.,
That wallpaper tho 👌,
20syl back in intros...love it,
Cool,
Still rocking my MacBook Pro 2014,
Intro music is too bitter 😖,
JWST ❤️,
People don’t realize that Apple does this on purpose so you subscribe to their iCloud services. People who can afford the higher storage will pay for it but everyone else who buys the base model will have to shell out $9.99/m for 2TB cloud storage. And now you’ve become more part of the Apple ecosystem,
"And to make it more confusing, between this M2 512GB Air and the 14""M1 you still have the M2 13"" Pro.
Price lader indeed well thought out.",
Decivingly expensive lol 😂🎉,
As a IT major college student I pre ordered the m2 MBA base model and later found out about the SSD speed. Really sad that already paying $1200 and then you have to upgrade another $200 for 256 more GB. I think it’s a rip off and I’ll use an external hard drive and I guess I’ll deal with the slow SSD speed if I have to encounter it one day.,
"I can't believe my first computer was a macbook pro... i feel ashamed. BUT, it was meant for school and got me through ENOUGH. still needed to bootcamp windows back then. and i love that you have no idea what laptop i'm talking about if i don't say a model year. fuck apple.",
love seeing videos of things I can't buy,
"Thank you for raising the fact that unless you’re buying the base model, this laptop makes no sense to upgrade when you can just buy a pro 14",
I come for the intros,
"Casey Neistat Tee, is it?",
"A school teacher asked me if she should get the new MBA today, do you think she gives a crap about the lower performance of 256GB SSD???? No, why because her outgoing machine is a 2013 MBP that was used and still works. The SSD is a non-issue to non-technical people, they just need a machine that is reliable. I'm typing this on my 2016 Dell Precision laptop, the 256GB SSD in the new MBP smokes my machine's SSD. Everyone needs to chill the F out.",
Please make a course on Intros,
Apple's laptop line is a mess. They need to make it more simple for the consumer.,
"But seriously tho, when are you guys going to build the tesla bot",
"I came for the intro, I stayed for the casey shirt, I left feeling enlightened why MBP13 exists",
"Solution 4: It’s a tool, not jewelry. Don’t stress about it if it has a few scratches.",
"What do you think is better for coding, 16gb ram 256gb ssd, or 8gb ram 512gb ssd?",
"1:55 ""A notch in the top-middle... quickly fades away to invisible.""
LOLOLOLOLOL, yeah no it doesn't.
Nobody wants a notch on their laptop.",
my mac doesn't do that glowy thing with the keyboard M key,
"$1199??? we must be buying at different apple stores, its $1400 for me",
MagSafe is back!?,
JWST images - Nice touch 👌,
Please never buy 256Gb version of Air. I did such dumb decision in 2019. I get rid of it in a year and bought a 512 Gb version instead ... and it 100 times faster. I think previous models from 2019 had same issue with slow 256Gb SSD.,
"Never the first to review, but always the best review.",
Would the 256/16 M2 air be sufficient for me? I'm a college student majoring in CS and I have 5TB of cloud storage so having just 256gb won't be much of an issue except for the slow SSD.,
Weird that you don't mention touch at all. Can I get one of these with a touchscreen? What's the price difference vs. the regular non-touch?,
"£2k for the 1TB model is a joke for a laptop with a notch and less GPU power than a Pro or a good Windows gaming laptop. I saw an M2 Air in real life at an Apple Store Sunday and other than the notch, it does look nice but the M1 Air taper is ergonomically superior hence some ASUS laptops raise the rear of the keyboard when you open the display. 
And yes why are both USB-C ports on one side? This and the notch are lazy mechanical design. I wish Apple would follow ASUS and try some industrial design bravado as well as excellent fit and finish, their core competency.",
Impressed by the cinematography at starting of video....❤️,
"After A long time, still confused about the product after watching your Video.😪",
ok can we get a BTS video for the clip at 0:08 ???,
Sick Intro yaw.,
"Why is everyone comparing the M2 Air with M2 Pro?
Yes, just to see what difference the presence of a fan makes. I get it.

But it's more reasonable to compare the fanless system to another fanless one, right? 
I mean, just compare M2 Air and M1 air. 

That should get more of the spotlight, IMO.",
Finally 😝,
"What an absolute legend. The vids are on the next level. 12 mins packed full of tech info, objective analysis and loads of feel good! Thank you MKBHD!",
"The apple apologists are out in full force, now complaining about benchmarking, and pushing the computer we're supposed to buy with our hard earned money. While the new air is undoubtedly a much better product, fanbois don't even want to mention the $200 or 20% price increase after 1.5 years! Marques said it perfectly, and honestly should be the main point! This is a essentially a $1500 laptop, and if you're not willing to shell out so much, get the older air.",
the intro was so fucking smooth,
are you still trying to figure out why Apple made the M2 Macbook Pro?,
JWST gonna be poppin out some lit wallpapers over the next decade 🔥,
@Marques Brownlee Do you think you could do a review on the Dell XPS 9320 and compare it to the M2 air? I have been debating over what laptop is better for overall work environments.,
Just take a moment to appreciate the greatness of that intro!,
What a intro!,
Midnight reminds me of iPhone 5's slate.,
"I think the old M1 Macbook Air with 16 GB Ram and 512 GB SSD would be the sweet spot over the new M2 Macbook Air. If you need more, go for the phenomenal Macbook pro 14 Base model. You will never regret that decision.",
That‘s the reasen why I think that Lightning isn‘t bad for the iPhone. It doesn‘t scratch the phone like usb-c does it. My iPad has the same problem not as bad than on the macbook air but the aluminum around the port is ab bit scatched.,
I like that M2 in the beginning of this video 👌👌,
coverfing the camere with your hand is such 2010 lame,
"At what point does it become ""too late"" to get the 14"" Pro? I don't want to face the situation where I spend $2k on a new laptop only to have a newer version released a couple months after.",
Amazing review simple straightforward and easy to understand,
"This ""review"" is line a thinly veiled apple commercial, like the verge.",
Amazing Intro,
Anybody else watch all his videos just to see the amazing intros? Absolutely loving the quality and creativity…,
someone drop the link for the wallpaper please 😩,
I want that wallpaper,
"I looked at M2 and bought Lenovo Yoga with an OLED screen and 6800u, 32GiB ram. Now I'll be able to do some scientific experiments right on my laptop.",
"Well a great applause to the DOP and the editor, as well as MKBHD great work guys.",
That into was soooo good!!!!,
I'm disappointed with M2 Air... Was planning to buy it but now considering old expensive M1 pro 14 instead 😐,
Can it handle a serious load without a fan?,
that intro was SICK,
11:00 I’m already regretting buying the base model lol,
Intro 🔥🔥,
why dont you review windows laptops?,
At the start the video transitions you used are similar to what Apple used during their keynote speech that's nice 😀,
Dat intro tho!,
"They need to bring back 11.6"" macbook air now that they have new technology. That with small bezel like this one will look amazing",
i don’t think im missing out on all that much having an m1 air tbh,
Well here in Sweden the m2 mba cost a little bit more but it’s not just 50 dollars extra no it’s 450 dollars extra FOR THE BASE MODDEL HOW LIKE WHAT WAS APPLE THINKING.,
"The MBA M2 is garbage , to get the ssd speeds of the previous M1 version you need to buy the next tiered version and by then it costs very similarly to MB pro 14 . It also runs very hot ckmpared to previous M1 models and unless you are getting the 10 core gpu with the 16gb ram and 512ssd then it is only marginally better than the m1 version.",
your intro was awsome,
That Intro is NEATT!,
For new buyer I think apple wants us to wait for some more time..buying 1500$ laptop and other side M1 chip which nw more than 2yr older...not satisfied with this M2 air thing..hope they resolve and find a way soon enough,
M2 not at all worth it. Steer clear everyone.,
Yeah the basic config is a way to lie about the msrp. 256/8 gb is a joke in 2022.,
"I coming from a 2012 MacBook Pro to the midnight blue Mac Air with 512gb and 16 gig RAM.  Love the magsafe, upgraded speakers, and new screen.  
Computer looks beautiful and it is a absolute beast!",
"I believe Macbook Air is made for CEO of any non-tech industry who doesnt know what is a NAND chip!

However i would believe that its a great machine for those who use productivity apps like keynote/Excel perfect corporate job.",
Aaaaaaand Apple is back to its overpriced best. This will help shift the stockpile of M1 Airs now.,
"Saw that celotape in the intro, used for guiding that smooth transition 😅",
GODDAMN THAT INTRO SHOT HOLYYYY,
"The single monitor output is so disappointing for the base M2 chip. I have a dual monitor setup at home, which works super well for my workflow. My $700 Lenovo Yoga 6 handles these dual monitors without issue, but the $1500 MacBook Air can't do that, and I have to spend hundreds more just to get a machine which can?
I would love to replace that laptop with a MacBook, thanks to the portability of the Air and better screen, but that second monitor is a deal breaker.",
Damn that intro was fire,
my 2021 ge76 from msi is 23mm thick🤣,
so unnecessary if you own an m1 air,
that nebula wallpaper is amazing ! where can i find those,
Where is the other Micheal,
"For a normal everyday usage, should I choose the 8GB RAM with 512GB SSD? Or should I go with a 16GB RAM with the base 256GB SSD?",
Did you Know  Apple 15 will have low SAR levels because soldiers get crazy! And their security will be fixed in model 16. Vasilakos TV Alter. Whatch you or opinion.,
"JUST SAVE UP $600 MORE AND GET THE BASE MODEL 14” MACBOOK PRO! 

Here’s 10 reasons why the base model MBP 14” is a way better value. 

1 - VALUE: on sale for $1800 at Best Buy / Amazon. That’s $200 off, which makes it just a $600 difference from base model MBA. 

2 - STOCK: readily available, whereas the Air is
brand new and can several weeks to ship depending on the model you choose. 

3 - DISPLAY: 1” bigger, even thinner bezels, higher resolution, 120hz Pro-motion, Mini-LED instead of cloudy/gray outdated LCD

4 - SOUND: Larger speakers for clearer/louder audio

5 - PERFORMANCE: Double overall performance, double the ram (16GB standard, compared to 8 on MBA)

6 - STORAGE: Double the storage (512GB standard, compared to 256GB on MBA)

7 - CHARGING: Faster charging out the box (MBA requires you to buy the upgraded charger to get faster charging)

8 - PORTS: Includes an SD Card reader, HDMI port, and 3 thunderbolt ports, and headphone jack (The only ports MBA has are 2 thunderbolts and a headphone jack)

9 - NO THERMAL THROTTLING: As a
result of the MacBook Air not having a built-in
cooling fan like the Pro does, the Air will drop
over 25% in performance after roughly 5 min of heavy workload, and it doesn’t take very long to throttle even under a moderate workload.

10. LONGEVITY: I’m no computer engineer, but I would expect the MBP to outlast the MBA, mainly because it has a built-in fan to help cool off the internals. And of course it’s more future proof, since it’s more powerful.",
Anyone know what desk he has in the background?,
Damn Bro That intro....🤯smoootthhhhh🔥,
"creative intro, love it❤",
Getting apple centric day by day 🤣,
crapple laptop is just worthless 🤷🏻‍♂️,
"I thought the prices at apple are expensive, because of development. But if we already, paid less for the m1 macbook air and they used the margin for the development of the m2 macbook pro, why are we still getting charged everytime apple is doing a refresh of a product.

Same with the iPhoneX. They showed us an outdated iPhone 8(7, 6s, 6) and then presented the iPhoneX with a notch, for what we paid more, but every manufacturer also published phone with a notch or a holepunch display. They sticked with the notch (x, 11, 12, 13) and now we are hearing that the iPhone14 is getting more expensive.. again because of redesign with a holepunch display that the samsung s10 already had in 2019. 
And after all of this boring years with a notch, they are putting it on the macbooks, with no reason. Becaue it would have fit on the macbook air.. because only „pro“ models deserve smaller bezels.. 
I am/was an Apple sheep since dhe iPhone3G, and switched to macbook sinc 2016. but its getting harder to still be happy with the brand, when they dont innovate and just care about charging more money for no reason.",
Finally 6a review worth watching from this channel. A good level of insight instead of just being on the fence.,
Are you going to comment about Apple lineup pushing HDMI 2.0 Ports in 2022? Such joke! Please give it visibility.,
Can you still charge it with USB - C!? New monitors have USB C charging and connection in one port,
the production value on this channel is beyond movies <3,
I sometimes wonder if I will ever buy anything from this company people are so obsessed with and the answer I arrive to everytime is *no*,
"We shouldn't consider this as an entry level laptop anymore 1500 Euros in Europe makes it much less of good proposition, and a whole different thing compared to what we used to associate ""Macbook Air""  with.",
5:10 You said that like an old Jedi Master,
It looks a lot like the surface laptops now,
nıce ıntro but there ıs a slıght machınary audıo at the back sıde. constatnly runıng.,
"That intro was sick and clean as hell, Marques. Great video!",
Does it come with Microsoft Windows installed because OSX is shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit,
"Damn. Visually there is no one on the same level as Marques and his team in the tech space right now. Often replicated, never duplicated.",
wait i love that aperture ring bracelet LMAO,
"I wish apple would do a MacBook Air 16. Having 2 browser windows side by side is what I need for productivity, and I don't need any M1 pro/max power. The 13/14 is too small, and the 16 is so big and heavy with all that power. I returned the 16 for the 14 as it was so chunky, now I miss the screen! There is no apple laptop for us that need a large screen but no crazy power.",
Stay away from beautiful apple users girls.,
Fire interview Marques! Appreciate the thought,
"But, but, but, all the other reviewers say that since you can’t edit 4 8k streams at once without thermal throttling makes it a total failure.",
"Funny enough, the base model M2 MacBook Air starts at 1,499 euros in Europe. if your spec it out with 16GB of ram and 512 SSD, it comes all the way up to 1,959 euros, while the base model 14"" MacBook Pro starts at 2,249, so the gap is even smaller.",
Loved the intro ✌🏻,
Damn that difference between M2 pro and M1 max pro is HUGE?!? Baffled that's there is a 1 hour difference. That's insane!,
"This intro, PERFECTION 😍😍😍",
Thumbs up,
What a great Intro! Just smooth and slick work 🔥,
where can i download that galaxy wallpaper plsss,
How would you feel if luffy got a weapon,
Try €1500 here in Holland for the base model…,
Is that Casey Neistat T-shirt??,
"Apple computers are bought just because: 
- they look fashionable 
- they are expensive 
- apple , people like this brand 
- people will do just basic stuff on them 🙄 😒 
- only 1% will use them to the max 
- nobody will care for 10 minutes gain, they need a faster connection 
My conclusion, if you heave money and like apple products with nothing in mind how to use it, sure is for you!",
Companies still using 1080p Webcam in 2022 is crazy to me. I've owned almost every MacBook.  But I refuse to buy one with a notch. That's absolutely ridiculous,
Awesome review! Does anyone else see the liquid spill on the first desk in the intro?,
Great T shirt Marques !!,
The intro is better than an apple ad,
The intro looks really awesome 👏,
Feel like watching a best hit music video,
"Im sticking with my M1 MBA, I don't render videos, but I do work with illustrator giant files simultaneously running photoshop and multiple other apps, in two years never had an issue.. plus is rose gold :)",
You are late.,
Super like to the nabula you show from James Webb! I might put it as a wallpaper too!,
Absolutely mind blowing intro damn good,
i’ll wait for linus tech tips to make an honest review,
"I just wondered why it looked so familiar to my MBP, but then I realized you also have the Webb telescope background picture like I do 😅",
Good presentation,
"Apple is a master and catching their customers between Scylla and Charybdis. So far, iPad w LTE is where they've trapped me.",
where I found this wallpaper???,
That new jwst picture,
"The M1 macbook air already has more power than an everyday user will need. As long as apple keeps it around, I kinda struggle to see who the base M2 macbook air is for.",
Apple should straight up use your intro,
i dont use apple pcs,
wallpaper link please!!,
I hate the sharp edge on the bottom below the touchpad. It irritates the palm. The old MBA thins down and you don't feel the bottom.,
Pricing on this is ridiculous outside of US. I'm in Europe and it starts at ~$1700 and if you want 512gb storage you are paying at least ~$2000. This is supposed to be the entry level model 😂,
Lets be honest... The wedge design is still better for the Air !,
if it doesnt fit inside an envolope is not an air,
Hey you stole my wallpaper.,
Wow ♥️ awesome 😍 laptop ♥️ 👍🏻,
"I only need a laptop for my work, mostly using Microsoft apps, Google Workspace and other apps. No video or photo editing, just work business related. I was aiming for the base model but after knowing it has the same issue with 1 nand chip like M2 MacBook Pro, I think I would opt now for Microsoft Surface Laptop Go 2 or any other basic Thinkpad laptops.",
More than a refresh it's a complete downgrade! WOOOOOOOOO,
The throwback Casey Neistat tee is a great touch! Love it 😎,
Anyone with a link to the NASA’s wallpaper?,
Why does this laptop look 100 different colors at the same time? 😅😅,
wallpaper Link,
are we not gonna talk about that inro,
"i plan on doing both school work and high production video editing, what laptop do you suggest for that? m2 macbook air? should i upgrade to 512GB? i really dont want to spend extra money unnecessarily",
😀😉,
The intro is sickkk,
"Wait, even with some type of dongle/dock it can only support one external display?",
"It sucks, I bought a MB Air like 3 months before the M1 came out so I ended up getting the i5 MacBook Air 2020 with 16gb of ram and 256gb of ssd storage so it's not the base model but the M1 still crushes it, my sister is going to University and she asked me what laptop she should buy so we went and got the M1 Air. I pit them against each other and first thing was the noise, mine ramped up to like 8000rpm during editing and the M1 just cruised right through without a peep. It's an amazing deal for what you get, the new one is nice but it should have been $999 like the previous, plus I'm actually more of a wedge shape guy, I don't find the flat design that good.",
ngl the intro was way better than the actual apple event,
"Again, are u or someone u work with immunocompromised? What’s with the mask wearing by yourself. Please don’t be “that” guy…",
I don't like the midnight color. It's just looks like dark blue. Meh.,
i just want that 'midnight' color for the macbook pro😫,
How many people really care about the finger prints or the ports scuffing.,
they should use your video's intro as an ad for the laptop....lol,
now i' m confused : which one shall i buy ? m1 base or m2 base ? ..........i don't play games or edit vdo .   200$ extra seem a lot to me.,
It’s kind of ironic that it’s name is MacBook Air bc it doesn’t have a fan,
It's always the intros for me🔥🔥,
"Your wallpaper looks alot like the glorious 16K
Cosmic Cliffs in Carina photo taken by the James Webb Space Telescope 🔭",
That's all ok but can it play CRYSIS?,
peep the shirt @casey,
Yessir the M1 14 inch pro is running laps around it,
why do you have a marimba on your desk?,
"Is it just me? Every time I watched his gadget videos I don't get lots useful info, feels like wasting time...",
In europe this laptop is way more expensive and it really sucks,
"funny question 
is the macbook air now a ipad pro running macos",
"this dude for real has $1,000+ in App Store credit",
"It's even harder when MicroCenter has the M1 MBA for $829 and the MBP M1 at BB is $1750 or even better, $1700 if they're desperately trying to get rid of open box models. Got lucky and got a mint open box for $1616 MBP M1.",
Also really good job on the outro man. Short and sweet. I heard on the Samir and Collin interview that you were working on that,
In India it costs $1400 😭😭,
At this point just build a PC for half the cost,
Love to suffer from Trackpointitis which means I can't even consider anything not made by Lenovo. The chip and battery life in this probably go hard but it's not even an option.,
i cant afford Apple products but i still watch these to know the innovations in Laptop and mobile world,
i dont like the small (Space Key ) looks horibble,
Love my M1 Air I just take mine to the coffee shop though lol!,
What a FIRE Intro!,
"amazing machine but for my needs the 2015 MacBook Pro 13 inch is the best companion. / uni stuff and Microsoft office apps , web browsing etc  /",
That intro... that intro...,
As soon as you break the seal on the box  it's out of warranty 😂😂,
i'll just wait for black friday/cyber monday to buy the macbook pro,
"These intros are actually insane, you guys are incredible",
No money anyways lol 😂,
No code compilation tests? Compiling the Linux kernel is a great test :),
A little work to robots huh?,
يا جماعة حد يتبناني و يجبلي اللاب ده لو مجاليش هاموت بجد😭😭,
i gotta change my pants after that intro,
"That wallpaper in thumbnail is JWST'S First coloured image.,😎space nerd Mkbhd",
Lovely intro.,
After the years of thinkpad existence it was so obvious that dark color is a fingerprint and dust magnet,
Who else has the webb pic as their bg?,
cool intro,
"BRO that intro could've been straight from Apple, my mind is blown.",
I really don’t need a Mac but I’d love to need one. This machine is so beautiful.,
When MKBHD’s intro is 100x better than Apple’s.,
marques where can i get ur casey neishirt?,
"I often wonder why thin and light is misunderstood. As stated in the video “if” one could, the preference would of course be to use the 13.6” device over a bulky 16 or 17” performance laptop like Mac Book Pro but… there is a reason creative users tend to use the bigger machines - sustained performance with appropriate cooling / airflow and lots of ports. The MacBook Air looks and feels great and is nice for causal editing, but by no means should be misinterpreted (however Apple positions it) as a viable alternative to powerhouse laptops.",
"I loved your take on this device. I’ve been watching so many reviews with different benchmarks and different ways to compare all the MacBooks but the way you summed the line up up at the end is just so simple and clear. Amazing work as always, no wonder you’re so successful!!!",
4) Dont Buy it!,
"Hey MKBHD! Awesome review. We're very glad that you mentioned the shortcomings of the M2 MacBook Air and we agree that this laptop should come with a 512GB SSD, and that it really should be a $1400-1500 laptop.",
"Let me rewatch the Intro, oh So Apple!",
Legendary intro=)),
Imagine if Apple was a German brand. M2 would be even more efficient…,
"I’m torn and frustrated with the new lineup, to get good M2 air specs is near $2k, it’s better to get the 13” pro but that one has the Touch Bar which I can’t stand and a bit more bulk which I’m trying to avoid. I wanted the midnight finish but I feel like the fingerprint issue will drive me crazy. At this point the M1 air is still looking like a superior option until they get their act straight.",
Amazing intro!,
"I really agree with what has been said about the price ladder. To get a decent amount more out of this than an Air M1 due to the base model SSD issue, you're right up in Pro 14 territory. At that point, the 14 feels like a decent investment due to the performance improvements it yields. However, I think it is designed to make you forget about the M1, which in all reality could do most of what users are looking for out of a laptop and is only about 1/2 the price.",
"Wow, was this cool video head shot by ""Dope Tech: Camera Robots!"" ?",
"I was super excited for this machine, even pre ordered it. This was going to be my first max laptop and I was hyped about having it for the new school year as I had been using a $200 chrome book for the last 3 years. It was finally the right price point and redesign that I was looking for. Pre ordered it, and then the reviews came out about the slower ssd and throttling. I canceled my order and am now back to using my chrome book. Really bummed apple decided to release it this way, but I can’t say it isn’t unlike them to do this.",
intro was lit,
I NEED THAT MASK,
+50 points for the latest pictures from the Webb space telescope!,
awesome and detailed review as usual. i was waiting for your thoughts. thank you bro keep it up,
"Too late, I don't care 😁",
"In 10 mins Marques helped me finally decide on something I’ve been pondering over for months, thank you!! I’m going with the pro instead of the air! *my pockets start whimpering*",
Why didn't you consider a setup with 256GB  SSD with a 16GB RAM. Would it have the same ssd performance issues ? I am planning for that as we can increase the SSD later on. And till then I plan to use my sandisk 1TB SSD for storage.,
Those animations were sick 🔥,
Always so happy when Marques drops a review on something I have been waiting a long time for. Never fails to impress with the quality of the video!,
I‘m from Germany and the MacBook Air M2 even costs 300€ More than M1 Air. I think this is just crazy,
Apple will always remain overpriced crap to me,
Thanks for sharing,
It's ugly.,
I wonder if Apple will release M3 and skip M2 in MacBook Pros,
That opening camera sweep from behind the laptop to above the keyboard and then zomming in to draw the M2 on the keys was brilliant! Nice work!,
The video quality just keeps getting better 🤟🏻🤟🏻,
What a beautiful mac imo...,
"Loved the intro, very slick. Thanks for the review also.",
"Im always excited to watch any MKBHD video, even if it is for a product I will never buy 😁",
where do i can get these wallpapere?,
"Honestly idc about these laptops at all there’s not enough benefit by literally the camera quality, it’s trashy! I would only get a MacBook Air for my gf and that’s it I’ll stay with my iPhone and just find another laptop that you can still do old school shit with.",
wow that intro!,
the M2 FX on the keyboard was 🔥,
You are spot on mate... I thought the same... I did not see a single reviewer cover what you just did..... You killed the intro...,
No one talking about sick Intro 💯,
Oh wew,
i need yor wallpaper from Webb! is it 4k?,
"50/10 great as always, the opening shot was incredible.. Not buying a macbook anytime soon but glad to have so much information of the lineup and the state of the apple ecosystem",
If somehow I get this MacBook I am will be really really good care of it,
My god that intro <3,
"I'm actually concerned about the screen size. Are 13,6"" enough? I'm a Unity game developer",
I want a new Mac mini with m2.... :/,
love to see the JWST space pics wallpaper!!,
The intro team deserves a raise!,
Is this the same as the pro?? I don’t get the difference,
"Nice intro, maybe could have removed the tape on the desk in post just to make it more yummy",
That was an intro. Love it,
dope intro,
"Writing this on a base model midnight MacBook air M2...kinda wish I'd got the 512gb now, but honestly, it's a sick looking machine, insanely thin and light and is quick enough for tasks I'm throwing at it. Even final cut works great. I wasn't in the market for a $2000 plus laptop here in Australia so the base model was what I went with, especially since I really wanted the new design language.  The ssd speed isn't a deal breaker it's just very disappointing and should definitely have been mentioned by apple on the website at a minimum.",
when everybody amazed how his intro was rather his m2 content,
"We peasants don's deserve this laptop, I will continue using my 2012 MacBook air.",
That spin @1:33,
sick intro!!,
"That intro was awesome, props to the team!",
The color reminds me of Dell Vostro (2018 ish),
"Awesome review as always, keep it up!
Where and when do you suspect the ssd speed difference between the 256 and 512 will show? Is it daily performance or on heavier tasks only?",
I love this shirt. And I love your Videos.,
"What point is there in getting any macbook air above the entry? You want performance, the maxed out air can't handle it without a fan. To do the same thing on PC, you're paying a few grand more. That 3 grand equates to a solid frame and nice body only. 

Looking at the MS surface though, press the middle of the keyboard in the space between the keys. Your finger nearly goes through it. Can't win with either company.",
"Now the software is the worst part of Apple laptops
It used to be the exact opposite",
That intro man. So slick!,
take off that useless mask,
I got that JWST pic as Background before!,
"Iphone 5 black scratch off color curse now is available on macbooks, thx apple",
"i love how marques put JWST's carina nebula's image as wallpaper
I guess everyone's doing that",
Intro is dope!,
Spen or apple pencil use on touch pad: kkk,
That laptop is already a piece of art but that wallpaper on it is just😍😍😍😍😍😍,
Cool :),
"please make a studio tour 2022, really enjoyed the last one:)",
Tech OG Brian Tong got a shoutout 😎,
"The intro was so cool,
Nice work guys",
its $1000 for a hamstrung GPU. This is a steal,
In Europe the base level model costs 1500 euro...,
That intro is sick,
"For the little performance bump you get, it seems better to get a 2020 model with 16gb and 1tb on the refurb store for about the same price as this one and you will have a damn great machine…",
Saw one of these in person at Best Buy and my gawd can I say it’s gorgeous but not enough for me to ditch my m1 MacBook Air,
I wanna to buy a good device for heavy user around $250-$300 anyone can tell me???,
"Meanwhile, in Europe (or at least in Spain) the MacBook Air starts at 1519€ with the 512 model being 1869€... Honestly, at those price points you just go buy an MBP 14"" for just over 2000€ with the usual discounts appearing on Amazon.",
"These intros have insane production quality, i thought i was watching a movie 🎥🍿",
I liked that starting 30 sec 💕,
these intros are soo goodd,
The animation for the M2 was insane :o :),
"Dear MKBHD, you inspire me to be a better version of myself. I think I got it too. Just don’t have the commitment. But these videos help. So thank you.",
The intro was so op,
Solution: just don't buy Mac !!❤️,
I just don't feel like the TIKTOK part was hitting. lmao,
It would be almost crazy to buy this instead of pro 14 if you're in Europe.,
That intro is awesome,
Im more less likely to click on a Clickbait Video as more of these come out,
"This fyrefest video was pretty good.  Not as good as Internet Historian's, but pretty good still.",
I don’t follow many “famous” people so I saw maybe 2 orange squares when I got on Ig that day. 😅,
lol funny you make video about a scammer while you put ads about crypto in the same exact video ??? disliked !,
Ignorant Americans,
Ja rule is a criminal? piece of trash,
WOW! I can't believe how EVIL this fraudster is.,
"Unpopular perspective: They paid a reasonable price for ""transformative experience"" and believed fully unrealistic stories about how this transformation would happen as a high luxury festival so exclusive that in theory only the wealthiest (and strangely themselves starting at 1k) would be able to attend it and bathed in luxury. Then, they got none of the unrealistic things but only a highly transmutative experience worth around what they paid - but no hundred thousands worth of free extras just for having decided to be part of the elite now and separate from normal society.

So, is it really a scam if people got what they paid for? It may have been a few days of hell on earth but they also got back out again safely and their entire lives definitely changed through this experience.

I dunno, i feel like subconsciously people exactly knew what they wanted from the experience and what it was worth to them but in order to get around their egos, it had to me covered into so many shinies that ego was willing to overlook all signs of where this was really going.

I mean, this is not defending the people who set it up from greed either - i just feel like a mysterious hand was involved there to allow for a very select crowd to be able to safely experience what it feels like to be hit with a catastrophe - without actually facing the consequences of a catastrophe in their real lives.

I mean, it's non-standard but still, it's widely known that life-changing experiences usually feel like hell on earth. They may turn into something beautiful once you've fully processed what you experienced but the moment itself, it's just always painful af.",
Kinda confused. Usually I learn about new stuff but there was like 5 diff documentaries about this? And almost everything in this video is stuff taken/plagiarized from the Hulu documentary? Is that a thing? Video plagiarizing?,
Jakes going to be making a video on when he scammed people into cripto.,
"So...wasn't the treasure hunt a clear red flag? i mean... anyway, have a nice day.",

"You know, despite you covering all these bad economic things, you accept ads from a damn bitcoin company? Might as well accept ads from an online casino LOL.

Would also be nice if you put chapters into your videos, heck, just put it in a description that says ""to skip ads go to:...""",
"3:10 I don't know that I could be as mad about everything else as I would be about a cheese sandwich. Imagine paying a thousand dollars, flying to the Bahamas and eating like you're an 8 year old latch-key kid.",
"Man I’ve been here for a long time and these videos are being more of a clickbait lately. Jakes quality is becoming lower and lower, I don’t think he even reads these comments at this point",
The clickbait tittle is starting to ick me off lol,
"the first time i heard of this was from internet historian, this video was cool as well",
"So am I the only one that think this channel has always been in the hands of a company, with a very good marketing team. They knew that having a face was more relatable and they used Jake’s, but slowly started using click bait titles, accepting shady sponsors, new narrators… that’s my theory.",
Still clickbaiting I see.,

Not a fan of the video title but I guess I got a story that includes rich people not getting away like the usually do.,
"Dude, I like your content but between your clickbait titles and seemingly slavish devotion to not saying what your video is, I can't share them because you have the vaguest titles on YouTube. I genuinely can't find a video I've watched since none of them have names.",
"well they did provide what they promised, unforgettable experiences !",
Jake like the content but recend vids seem to similar to other creators,
This private documentaries are a scam YouTube already pays u dumbass,
This whole channel will die with this trash narrator,
Suggestion to the Islanders.. start your own festival with own local carrabian music and invite all..,
Blink 182 working for THIEVES?,
Jake I love u brother,
Effery Jepstein,
This is one of the funniest things I've never heard of. Celebs getting their comeuppance,
"finally you made a video about this
can't believe internet historian beat to the punch on this topic",
This is such a watered down story already,
"is it just me, or does this no longer sound like Jake is narrating these recent videos?  Sounds like a completely different person, more than just an audio upgrade or mic upgrade. Something is up.",
What's incredible is how close the Cl1ntnones were to Jepsteen and to Google apparently. Why demonetize the truth? Because the libreeel eeeleeet gl0ballalaists all took part.,
"Please remove the camera capture sound, some people like me can't concentrate with that noise and it shocks my brain and makes me jump.

Great content as always btw 👌love it and I don't miss a single upload",
Lamo this dude said it’s the best time to buy Crypto 😂 Tran never gets old,
"Unfortunately, I have been subscribed long enough to see Jake Tran, once a hero fighting against scams, now become the villain and join crypto scams himself. I really appreciate the work you put into your videos and don't mind you having sponsors but need to be coherent with yourself and walk your talk. It's called integrity. You call out influencers and celebrities that are pushing scams to their followers and yet in the middle of denouncing such behavior, you do the same. Nice to have known you. Unsubscribing.",
So did any of the musicians end up performing?,
Is nobody going to comment on narrator calling Jeffrey Epstein “Effrey Jepstein” like 7 times in a row ? 😂,
Does Jake become another dude sometimes? I swear the voice changes back and forth,
"I'm just gonna put this here now - With the type of videos he makes ,and then the type of sponsors he's using.. Jake Tran is gonna disappear in a year or so, and his last video will be about himself, how he scammed and manipulated people for 2 years via his youtube, and made absolute bank doing it...",
I see you watched the Netflix documentary,
Real ones know the Internet Historian’s video on this 😂😂,
Some people need to just unsubscribe and move on. Who gives a fuck who sponsors Jake THATS HOW HE MAKES MONEY TO KEEP UP THE CONTENT what do you think he can make All these videos and do all this research for free??? Stop acting like he's the bad guy here I need more of this shit alot more get out the way,
This channel is becoming nothing more than a click bait story to run ads. A nothing burger filled with advertisements.,
Haha don't feel bad for any of these ppl.,
"""This fraudster got what he deserved."" 
This is a clickbait title right there. 
The guy in the video only got sentenced to 6 yrs in jail which it's supposedly 10 yrs.
The vid said he got released 1 yr early. He should have served full 10 yrs in jail.",
Ja rule will not like this,
Am I the only one who never saw the orange pic post,
At least these rich kids got to experience a day in the life of regular ppl.,
https://youtube.com/shorts/FDoWgzo1m7o?feature=share,
First time hearing of this festival scam. Now I have to change my channel name 🥲,
haha,
Thats why I leave parties at least 1 hour before it's over,
"the catharsis of seeing those dumb normies waste their money on such a stupid thing, only to be ripped off",
Bahamas = Raped children you've never heard of,
This seems... What's the word.... Evil weird it's not in the title...,
Woahwoahwoah suddenly all these negative comments what did I miss guys?!!???,
You became a rich c£nt that’s all I can see,
"500 dollars 2 week stay on an island.
Yeah that's how you get your kidneys stolen",
I think we should do it again but this time not save the super rich.,
Your next video should definitely cover the UBER scandal going on lately. How they lobbied politicians,
Ja ja Binks,
Dude stop with the scam ads. Find better quality advertisers or your channel will die from hypocrisy.,
Jake really just tried to say Coachella is affordable for everyone lmaoooooo rich boi alert,
"This channels going down the shitter

Fun while it lasted eh",
"Your such a snake with advertising, there will be a video about you being evil soon!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Leave us alone , planet’s crap enough",
Jajjajajajajajjajajjajajajajja,
IRONIC > speaks of SCAMS while also pushing to INVESTING in one >> Crypto,
"Jake Tran: first I would like to thank our sponsor, ""SUPER EXCLUSIVE LUXURY MUSIC FESTIVAL INCORPORATED""
Click the link for 15% off your $12,000 ticket",
Wicked editing,
"Unsubbed, stop scamming man...",
"How tf an ending like this is “got what he deserved”? Overly exaggerating the truth while making a video of fraud, are you serious?",
u learn this stuff about jeffery in school we watched a doc in my school on him .love your vids dunno were u get the facts about whats thought in schools .maybe its american schools i dunno but not were im from,
"Man i really like your content you have some good quality stuff, but these thumbnails and extreme clickbait titles without any info always make me go ""yeah i think im gonna skip that one"" when i see them in my feed",
effrey jepstein?,
"I went to Fyre festival and it was AWESOME! 
Can't wait to go next year.
Said no one ever.",
"Jake, I'm a big fan but the thumbnail of a white man with red eyes pointing towards something is just getting boring and repetitive now. It's good to attract new audiences because it's clickbait, but at some point your regular viewing audience will get tired of it. And I've seen some persons on other videos expressing the same.",
"There's a generational cohort of suckers born every day.
(And that's still funny.)  🤠",
let me guess another vid with someone else voicing it,
Jake sold out. Dude is barely any different than the people he makes videos about. Used to love the content but it’s disgusting to be advertising clearly predatory sponsors. I hope he gets back to his old quality vids and without the scammer sponsors.,
lol serves these idiots right,
"Jake, PLEASE go back and rename the titles to all your videos into something more user friendly... Trying to go back and search for previous videos is a HUGE pain in the ass 🤦",
That could've been an actual good event if billy wasn't a dumb cnt,
sellout,
Do the TRUMP UNIVERSITY SCAM,
"Honestly he is a boss, he screw thousands of idiots that worship artists with just stock footage lol,  they thought they where going to be part of a giant expensive orgy and all they got was a lonely fap in a FEMA tent ⛺ hahaha",
I'm not trying to play devil's advocate but the millenial generation is filled with people like this who scam to get ahead. They are the product of what this country has become when greed and narcissism are fostered and honesty and hard work is laughed at.,
So all these high-net worth luxury peeps could fly in but not fly out and were stranded?,
I did a paper on Fyre Festival back in 2019 and the documentary on Netflix was amazing to watch. It's crazy watching Billy actually try putting a festival together and seeing how it fell apart,
"somehow since this channel turned into a ""team"" the content got worse instead of better, feels like half the video is a mix of intro that gets repeated later, AD's, and asking for people to Join channel when if they really wanted to give content away as cheaply as possible they could post on another paid sharing site most people who watch this channel likely pay for, or at least if not it would be cheaper then a monthly subscription like nebula or curiosity stream",
"Standing up, Paul motioned with his hand and said: “Fellow Israelites and you Gentiles who worship God, listen to me! The God of the people of Israel chose our ancestors; he made the people prosper during their stay in Egypt; with mighty power he led them out of that country; for about forty years he endured their conduct in the wilderness; and he overthrew seven nations in Canaan, giving their land to his people as their inheritance. All this took about 450 years. “After this, God gave them judges until the time of Samuel the prophet. Then the people asked for a king, and he gave them Saul son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, who ruled forty years. After removing Saul, he made David their king. God testified concerning him: ‘I have found David son of Jesse, a man after my own heart; he will do everything I want him to do.’ “From this man’s descendants God has brought to Israel the Savior Jesus, as he promised. Before the coming of Jesus, John preached repentance and baptism to all the people of Israel. As John was completing his work, he said: ‘Who do you suppose I am? I am not the one you are looking for. But there is one coming after me whose sandals I am not worthy to untie.’ “Fellow children of Abraham and you God-fearing Gentiles, it is to us that this message of salvation has been sent. The people of Jerusalem and their rulers did not recognize Jesus, yet in condemning him they fulfilled the words of the prophets that are read every Sabbath. Though they found no proper ground for a death sentence, they asked Pilate to have him executed. When they had carried out all that was written about him, they took him down from the cross and laid him in a tomb. But God raised him from the dead, and for many days he was seen by those who had traveled with him from Galilee to Jerusalem. They are now his witnesses to our people. “We tell you the good news: What God promised our ancestors he has fulfilled for us, their children, by raising up Jesus. As it is written in the second Psalm: “ ‘You are my son; today I have become your father.’ God raised him from the dead so that he will never be subject to decay. As God has said, “ ‘I will give you the holy and sure blessings promised to David.’ So it is also stated elsewhere: “ ‘You will not let your holy one see decay.’ “Now when David had served God’s purpose in his own generation, he fell asleep; he was buried with his ancestors and his body decayed. But the one whom God raised from the dead did not see decay. “Therefore, my friends, I want you to know that through Jesus the forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. Through him everyone who believes is set free from every sin, a justification you were not able to obtain under the law of Moses. Take care that what the prophets have said does not happen to you: “ ‘Look, you scoffers, wonder and perish, for I am going to do something in your days that you would never believe, even if someone told you.’”
Acts 13:16‭-‬41 NIV
https://bible.com/bible/111/act.13.16-41.NIV",
"This is an example of why people need to learn to create and have someone in their life they can be fully honest with and receive criticism and get loud and maybe even throw a few punches sometimes and it is vital that the person is a balancing act in your life of either reason and logic or worry and fear, have the capacity for both. you will be able to give the necessary push back and voice of cold reason and negative reality or the positive reenforcement and open mindedness when needed. An example is my business partner and close close friend wants to build the biggest and most talked about and beloved music recording and events coordinator company in Utah it’s one of his life goals and dreams besides going to sushi school in Japan. He is so hungry for it that in four months we’ve gotten to where it takes most in the edm and rap/ hip hop industry in Utah he also will make fast decisions out of excitement even sometimes down right bad situations. Expensive ones. But not as many as could have been if it weren’t for being the voice of reason in his head. He almost walked us into a super bad festival that has only ever broke even twice and profited only 5k at most  other years. It is also offense to a lot of people cause it was a bunch of White House’s putting on a house edm show and calling it a pow wow.
If there was a business partner that cared this wouldnt have happened I think.
It’s hard to find and have friends that truly care for you when in business without money being the main motivator. We live in a culture where everyone wants to be the king, the mastermind, or even like a ring leader but no one wants to be ‘just’ the right hand man no one wants to be leader of the kings court if they can’t be the king. They don’t even think of the fact that they would be the first to whisper in the kings ear.So many people throw so many opportunities away simple out of a horrible pride because for whatever reason no one can accept a lot of seemingly basic and necessary social skills and work character integrity",
Bro why would you cover something so well known?,
"JaRule got off too easy.

Billy may of been the “mastermind” but plenty of people along the way knew of the scam and made money along the way.",
Truly 🔥,
"What is up with the recent long drawn out typing of what's on screen. makes these videos uber slow and painful to watch, Jake!",
Thought it was hilarious because most the people that got ripped off where just yuppy trust fund babies.,
"What happened to this channel, it went from quality content releasing every month to click bait titles and not as much ibdepth video or interesting released every other day.

If you made 2 separate video categories that would be better",
"Despite the economic downturn,I'm so happy☺️. I have been earning $ 60,000 returns from my $7,000 investment every 13days..",
I never saw that orange thing before this is crazy tho,
Sup Jake,
"I really liked you're documentaries and have been watching all you're videos, but this crypto push you're doing is just plain immoral. You talk such a big game about scams, frauds and so forth but don't even have a disclaimer about the risks involved with those cryptoplatforms?

Especially now when platforms are going bankrupt people need to be given a disclaimer.

I write this, not for myself, but for us who like the content but detest the way you have been conducting yourself. Simply put you have been selling out. Instead of growing you're community you have decided to milk it for all its worth by making flashy video documentaries about the rich and the elite, while cashing in...

As cliche as it might sound... Jake Tran has become the very thing he documents and this type of content needs to be called out for what it is. An ad dressed up to be an informative documentary",
"Jake I know you don't like doing a lot of work but bro if you talk for the first 5 min then switch to someone else it's crazy to think we won't notice , you make youtube videos lets try a little harder",
Poor people☹️,
Internet Historian ey ?,
I remember this guy and ja rule back in 2014 were promoting an exclusive  black card. When I saw this in 2017 I knew it was going to be a huge flop.,
Stop begging for money,
"Ja rule another terrorist Giselle Maxwell Vatican friends royalty 

How many children had been raped and murdered on that island?",
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA,
"8:13

George Harrison had something a lot different to say about Woodstock. From memory he saw it as not some concert of peace and love, but one of debauchery and looseness. He was disgusted by it. A Beatle was disgusted by a music festival, think about that. It's not like he hadn't taken his fair share of drugs and committed his share of sin. 

Kinda why the world is so fucked up. Irresponsible people thought the world was a game for a decade, so they could sit back, run their credit up, take mind altering drugs, teach children stupid lesson's and run some of the most important institutions when ""the game"" was over.

I wouldn't be surprised if Woodstock was a Government Operation. Mockingbird, Northwoods and Paperclip sound outlandish yet are completely true. Was this the start of the family breakdown? To get people to turn away from God? Partake in ""free love?"" Drugs? Because it seems that from then on America changed, for the worse.",
"What is amazing to me is that they actually managed to market this well enough. It shows just how easy this 'luxury' lifestyle is to fake. Literally just a few ads and some famous names and that's it, that was enough to convince the rich dummies. Honestly more funny than anything",
Never been this early,
Video starts at 5:43 trust me.,
"Guys if you are unhappy with the direction of the channel, simply unsub, dislike don't watch the videos...",
Jake is right about the fake accounts,
Netflix copy and paste,
Not going to lie it's kind of gratifying seeing all of these snobby privileged influencers be put in an actual survival situation and have no idea how to act,
Dude tells me to ignore him if he asks me to me to invest and then moments later asks me to invest. What did he mean by this?,
"I love this video, but don't you think the sound effect is too loud?",
Lmao such a wild move to just switch up narrators like that you bitch 😂,
"Mr. Jake Tran, I only watch quality YouTube videos such as Jordan Peterson, MKBHD, David Goggins, Veritasium, the godfather Kevin Samuels and I'm sure I could go on. Your the only channel I'm subscribed to. I used to only pay for Thoughty2's subscription but recently I canceled him and now I only pay for your subscription. Sean Dawson used to be the best conspiracy videos on YouTube but now your the best. Your videos aren't conspiracies, they are hard cold facts and nobody can argue with that statement because of the effort and work you put into the research and presentation of your videos. I salute you sir and the speed in which your putting out these marvel videos is astonishing to say the least. You sir are a hero, and you have no fear. Keep up the good work man we really need to hear the unbiased truth before it's too late for the free world and they make it illegal to post these kind of videos. Godspeed son 💪",
"Jake, you've been my inspiration for starting my project. Although it's a different genre, you are my motivation.",
people like him and elizabeth holmes likely suffer from extreme cases of sociopathy,
This channel is just clickbait now lmaoo,
.. another bullet 50 Cent gun,
"MANNNNNN are u really shelling crypto crap to your fans bro seriously 😒😳 smh sad.... ""Special bonus"" 😂😂 yea for us to get robbed 😂😂😂😂",
Everyone that bought in got what they deserved. No empathy or sympathy!,
I just cant watch these videos if Jake isnt narrating them lol,
"Remember when these WEREN'T just ads???
Me neither.",
Ngl the clickbait titles and the outsourcing of the narration has me checking this channel for new uploads less and less,
"No transparent communication, no budgetting and a guy that does not give a damn =  Masterpiece",
Lol internet historian covered this years ago. Its breathtaking.,
Hi Jake. You need to get back to narrating you own videos and taking on harder topics. This one has been covered enough. You are currently riding the success wave of your older videos.... This won't last.,
I wish I could win this week😆,
Infestival,
Who remembers watching this on Internet historian,
Rich kids suffered at the festival.....    THAT MAKES ME HAPPY 🤣,
Because everyone rich is on Epsteins list. Hear the wisp singing? It's a judges twist.,
"Every influencer who plugged it should’ve been fined too, people having liability for advertising fraudulent activities would stop the shilling of dodgy crypto etc",
"plane ran out of gas, he couldn't even plan the flight",
"This is kinda old news 😸 
Here I am expecting another video about an evil corp :(",
Fie on rhe fyre festival,
"These idiots who put on massive festivals have not learned a thing from their predecessors (Woodstock/ '83 US Festival, etc.) that they're basically a train wreck waiting to happen. I worked the US Festival as an off-duty cop pulling security and it was a shit show from start to finish. Rapes and crime, in general, we're in the big numbers not to mention the infrastructure. I mean who puts on a festival in the damn desert. At least it had two upstart tech pioneers throwing the gig that made good on their financial obligations. You may have heard of them: Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak.",
"15:08 ... There are max 3 Stars for Restaurants/Chefs ,5 is only Hotel ... Great vid anyway oc",
I would of been pissed lol,
"Just because Jake told truth about usa ?
How Usa destroyed south America and now people complaining about Jake telling lies in his channel is just disgusting 
Everything was fine as long as jake was telling things about China and Russia but when he try to tell truth about America everything was lie and wrong",
Great analysis-just like everyone else did on their channel a couple years ago-,
"chained and stranded on an island, i would've thought this was the start to a life or death gameshow with the rich and influential. lol",
"Idk if it’s because I’m a marketer, but I absolutely love this whole story. Marketing was genius, the idea (if you suspend reality) was genius. Everything except the actual festival was well planned out and executed.",
Whoa what? Jake uploaded a video with a title that actually has something to do with the video. Did we get sucked into the multiverse or…,
"Out of 6 years, just 1??  He *DIDN'T* got what he deserved at all !",
"This channel was once so good...but man, things change.",
2017 era thumbnails lol,
Never trust a man named billy,
One of the best creators,
"He definitionally got what he deserved! Shy of 6 years plus got out a year earlier than he should have. That will show him!  At this point I'm not sure if your siding with the people who got scammed or the scammer, since you got to gull to promote a scam yourself.",
so he scammed a bunch of rich snobs and shallow show-offs. he is a hero,
Who’s the guy that narrates the majority of your videos,
I haven’t laughed this hard in awhile oh my lmao could you imagine you think your all high class and special and fly in to that lmao,
This is OLD NEWS man...,
jake didnt narrate? dislike move on,
Love these documentaries,
I remember This Scam.. People Really fell for it 😂,
The Internet Historian has a good documentary about this.,
We can all agree that he never disappoints us with his content ⁦🌹,
Advertising a scam in a video about a scam lol,
“Tickets to these events only cost a few hundred dollars.” Am I the only one who still thinks that’s expensive?,
Aww poor rich suckers got suckered?! Ha ha ha!,
I just started watching Jack's videos last week and I'm enjoying the content but some of his sponsors are scammish af. Like one about magic cereal that is completely healthy,
They all got what they deserve,
This whole thing (and opulent festivals in general) is so gross. I feel no sympathy for anyone except the citizens of that island who were jipped.,
The irony in the name.,
Bruh stop following the guidelines saying the biggest promoting lies from company brokers,
"Man, those sponsors...",
"iTrustcapital, sounds big time scam",
I really like how you are still trying to keep Effery Jepstein relevant. Its sad that situation isnt in the forefront,
Idk about this one. Didn’t feel like I learned anything. Just a shoveled out video and a basic summary.,
Do we have to eliminate the Plutocratic terrorist and his microphone artist allies?,
As someone who lives in the Bahamas I remember seeing this back in 2016-2017 a laughing saying that these kids are going to get scammed,
"Usually only scummy douchey types of people would be interested in such an event so they all deserved this ""vacation"". One smart guy simply took advantage of these morons. All these influences and self assessed celebrities can go burn in hell anyway. Too bad this didn't turn out to be a surprise Saw movie plot for the participants",
So if wealthy peopleget scammed there is justice but if it was normal people nothing would have happened.,
Fools and their money soon part ways.,
The swap between narrators was smooth,
"Jake be like after few months, how my sponsor went bankrupt by it's shaddy practices lol",
"Damn, the fyre festival? Hasnt almost everyone made a video on this? :/ I dont really look forward to your content much these days. its gotten boring and bland, no offense",
"Make a video about Sri Lanka's Current crisis too, which was caused by economical mismanagement and other various factors.",
"jake, its a 20min video. narrate it your damn self",
Unsubscribing . Hypocrite.,
Effrey Jepstien did not kill himself,
LOL pumps a scam during fraudster video...fkn clown,
First kekek,
"Amazing video as always. 
1:30 Romania 🇷🇴♥️",
fucking hell - this has been done to death on youtube - find stuff that doesnt have 50 videos on YT already,
Crypto is a SCAM! Its just a ponzi scheme. Its a big banker designed one world currency to eliminate cash so all transactions can be completely tracked and controlled so all peoples can be completely enslaved! Wake low IQs!,
Did I just hear Jeffrey Epstein backwards Effrey Jepstein @17:10,
"Had those scam artists held that Fyre Festival thing in say or March or April 2020, they could have canceled the ""festival"" the day before and just cite COVID as the reason for canceling, but keep the money for themselves.",
"I swear, this guy purposely mispronounces names and words. 
His ads are also irritating. Unsubbing 😂😂😂",
Jake spitting out fire content as always!,
Don't think of it as a scam. Think of it as an participation-art-exhibit focusing on the plight of the refugee. THEATRE!,
This is the same fyre festival mentioned in inventing Anna..??,
The exposer of fraudsters became the frauder,
the spoiled kids crying was satisfying,
Now is not a good time to get into crypto but jakey boy needs his ad revenue huh,
Jake tran not attention grabbing here but I worked at the Fyre fest and truthfully they frickin played us and told us we would make 800 dollars every 24 hours we worked overtime literal night and day setting up fulty tents we got none of our payments promised but I nice lady from Miami paided me 400 bucks to help after it fell apart and we had to break tents back down.,
half the video AD and promoting to pay documentary  and repeating the same photo and info for the food,
"I wish I could go to a Ultra and EDC festival, but I think I missed that train. Have some bad back injuries from the Army. Can't really sit down and watch it while in person. But anybody that's been or is going; enjoy your time, you're one lucky son of a gun",
i think the guy is actually based.  anyone who goes to those festivals deserve to lose their money,
Jake. Love your channel previously. But I can just tell with this video you are done. It’s over. Narrator? Sus ads? Clickbait? Dumb over told story? I’m sorry but you just proved you aren’t sustainable.,
"It’s time to unsubscribe, this channel is going down the tubes now",
"Old video titles: The profitable business of concentration camps.
New video titles: This company is pure evil.

I dont like the new direction of the channel at all. Now its just wannabe youtube journalism. The old channel slogan ""business is complicated"" is so much better than ""Money. Power. War. Crime.""

These arent ""Premium documentaries"". This is just a random guy saying ""powerful group X is soooo evil"" for 20 to 30 minutes. For that I can just read a history book tbh.

Your old videos had charm. Your new videos are just boring. I just cant do this any longer.",
"for any1 investing in crypto. if it aint yo keys, it aint yo crypto",

Jake's really been milking the fact that the dislike button is gone.,
"Clickbait. He didn't get what he deserved, he got off real easy.",
🗑,
"Eh, Internet Historian did it first and did it better.",
I know scaming is wrong but how do you get scammed this hard,
"*https://youtu.be/mCfYi7634rU*
Finally its here.",
Stop the camera clicking sound it is way to loud and please go back to voicing your own videos this guy you have now is garbage and way too aggressive,
Third,
Ignorant! can’t even spell Colombia lmao,
👌,
so those artists are thieves?,
He should have just cancelled the whole thing and cut his losses after the $20M investment failed to push through. That would have caused the least amount of inconvenience for everyone involved.,
To be honest he was really almost close enough. The video puts it like the experience of the guests was supposed to be the priority but it never was. It was the content people can produce while being there having paid that much. Just had to make the food and the sleeping conditions look good on photos smh and it would work I'm convinced,
"This channel has gone to the dogs, guy doesn't give a rats ass about quality assurance any more.",
imagine getting standed in a  island and then  it turns into a battle royale .,
Imagine that sucks for everyone involved but if u down to drop that much on a festival than jokes on u,
we NEEEEED a video on andrew tate,
"""I will never ask you for money or ask you to invest in anything"" he says then does an AD all about investing your money..... Hmm.. Then I will take your advice and NEVER look into your supported ads.",
Still trying to figure out if this was an outright scam or if this guy just really sucked at putting on festivals?,
"I’d you’re willing to pay 12k to see a show, you deserve to lose your money.",
17:09 effry jeipsten,
I suddenly miss Internet Historian. I learned of this from his vid,
I’m surprised this video had so few spelling mistakes. The people making your videos stopped eating crayons and actually used a spell checker?,
"Your videos are amazing man. I love listening to them while I work, it makes the time fly AND I learn something. So, thank you.",
America is the devil in design 🤫,

"Nice title, this will get people to stop saying you're helping scammers 😆  , I'm j.k I just remember the latest videos comments haha",
These filthy rich pop culture influencer followers get what they needed (maybe even what they deserved for some of them): a reality check.,
26m usd and he can't make it happen?,
"Is anyone actually asking their refunds? 

I’m curious if the YouTuber talking about scams is running one… i love his videos and want to believe so bad but it’s hard to believe anything now a days. Someone reassure me 😅😅

#freepalestine ❤",
Someone's running out of ideas,
this video made me want to unsubscribe,
Cheese sandwich. Gets me laughing everytime.,
Lmfao the poor elite got scammed 😂,
Find it really ironic how you make videos criticising bad people and yet 5 minutes into the video you start promoting a service completely centred around people gambling with their pensions,

"60k, I bet Mr. Beast could pull this off if he wanted to.",
"When you name your crypto firm ""I Trust Capital"", it makes it quite hard to believe any amount of capital will be safe in your hands.

ok.....,
"Imagine being consistently high jacked for the carbs u earn only to have little to no one to fight for your consumer rights.

I think a series on Netflix was inspired from such incident,
FOR THE LOVE OF GOD PLSSSSS STOP PLUGGING YOUR CHANEL membership I get it man just tell the story straightforward and stop adding fluff,
"Jake, voice.. is just bad. Just do this by yourself.",
Good concept bad execution. If he had 3 years of planning before the actual festival it would have worked.,
Oh i remember this I have no clue how they got away with this probably just because the influencers,
DuDE Jake! ...Create some new content man ...most of your stuffs these days are just recycled documentaries ..IV SEEEN THEM BEFORE from other people!!!!,
Fyre actually did happen... What was promised was delivered to the ones making the advert.,
"I'm surprised that just showing, ""Mr. I didn't do myself in."", doesn't get this video kicked these days.",
"Your videos are always the same, some businessman is enslaving a country, and the thumbnails won’t change",
Been waiting for you to do this video! Haha loved it Jake!,
I’m technically the first comment after Jake,
The new wave of titles sucks ass. This narrator guy's storytelling is dull and boring,
Clickbait title not related to subject. No description at all that describes the subject..,
Lmao buy crypto because it's a dip. It's crashing because it's a scam,
"lol, rich kids who (most of them but I'm sure not all of them) burnt money they didnt earn and got sad about being scammed....",
I want to watch your videos but they're SO click batie,
Runing out of content from wiki? Last few videos is stuff we all heard a thousand times,
"Crazy how ja rule got off Scott free, money hey",
The biggest news no one is talking about https://youtu.be/YilL9f4O47M,
If this actually happened like it was supposed too it would be amazing. It was a shame what happened.,
"Lmfao, I'm glad these dumb fks got scammed",
"Jake finally selling out. Pushing crypto scams and using others for the voiceover. Shame, it’s been fun but I’m out.",
I would have just got a big tent,
Never got the square lol,
“Effery Jepstein”,
"DONT TRUST THE SPONSOR, ALL THE CRYPTO BANKS ARE FALLING RN, AND YOUR WALLETS WILL BE FROZEN",
"His videos these days either have the clickbaity titles or it is ""fear-mongering"" the viewers about the topic of the video. Try to keep the title more neutral instead of using strong words.",
This is the Cayo Perico DLC from GTA Online,
"@Jake Tran I love this one,lolzzzz",
"the only victims were the workers, everyone else got what they deserved",
Every festival is a crap show especially for the performers. I’ve been involved and it’s always like this.,
This whole story will never not be funny AF.,
"Nope, Jake is still not narrating his own videos.",
"Netflix also has a great documentary on it, but this one is next level",
"Is it just me or is the new guy saying ""Effery Jepstein"" ...?

 I'm pretty sure its ""Jeffery Epstein"" 😂",
"""The storm turned all of the marketing....into lies.""",
"Literally watched the Netflix docu-movie on Fyre Fest yesterday, crazy how insane the behind the scenes were.",
Damn I've never even heard of this lmao,
Maxwell is the only person charged with sex trafficking minors to no one,
"17:32 The infamous ""Effry Jepsein""",
I read a article about this fool in the video.,
*Your videos are always the best do receive a notification each time you post a new video.. We'll have regrets for things we did not participate in..Investment should always be on any creative man's heart for success in life.*,
Not everyone’s feed. Someone of us didn’t follow these basic wyt girls,
Only by the thumbnail we know what this is,
My new favorite part about Jake videos is reading all the hate lmao fuck this channel,
"Kinda ironic the sponsor is called iTrustCapital considering the nature of this channel. Nice videos though.

"Love ya jake, but let's go dude.  This has nothing to do with anything, except maybe instagram.  A doc came out a while ago on nf.  Dig deeper y'all",
God Bless Fyre Fest for ripping those rich fucks off,
Very sad to see that this channel seems to be on a slow descent,
"What a great way to get rid of all the richy bas..
All put in an island in the middle of nowhere.",
All those cunts deserved to get ripped off. Beautiful 😎,
"Nice video! Loved the Netflix documentary on it as well! But please listen to us if we say it's not a good idea to ""expose"" or talk about scams if you're most likely promoting a scam yourself!",
Stop shilling crypto.,
"I just find it somwhat hillrious that when the fich get scammed the consequences are allways there quick and harsh...
Just like madoff...
Were poor people scamed too sure...
Bahamian's charities etc...

Non the less the biggest bloe was to people who were willing to pay thousands of dollars to party...

One could argue they can afford oh idk insurance basic reaserch into the company and so on...

Don't get me wrong i'm not saying the rich should've been scamed or anything like that but still
I find the backlash being this severe in these circumstances funny",
MANNNNNN this is older than you kid 😂,
His name is BILLY come on lol,
How many times are you going to talk about Jeffrey Epstein lol,
"As your only contribution to these videos is the ads I'm done with your channel, maybe i'll come back if you go back to legit content that isn't blatant copies of other peoples videos that are then narrated by someone else.",
Jake’s video ideas are definitely getting slim but I’ll still support this video with a like,
"Jake, your sub count slowed down by 42.9% in last 30 days, and views came down by 30% in last 30 days. 

Maybe you should take a hint, that promoting scam websites and being dishonest with your audience is a not going to work?",
"I agree with the notion that you should dial down the clickbaits, it's become the *what's the most evil thing this week?"" show.",
I'd like to see a : How JakeTran lied and cheated to his loyal fans & the decline and downfall of Jake Tran,
I was wondering when you'd get around to this one,
Jakes content has honestly taken a serious dive in quality. I’m sure he’s grown his audience and business but covering an old story that everyone already knows with a clickbait title? Cmon man. Quality over quantity. Most of these videos aren’t even Jake anymore,
"This video was kind of a shill in a shill, It was kind of like watching a 15 minute commercial. unsubscribe.",
Hunter hooker's haidid and Emily Ratajkowski,
There is a sucker born every second 😂,
I miss the early Jake when he was more about creating good content than click bait titles and revenues from whatever shady thing.,
"Video without his voice dosent feel the same, maybe needs to look into more options.",
Effery jepstein,
This narrator is way better than jakes annoying voice and lmaoo jakes apocalyptic tone of speech. Gosh was so annoying.,
"It’s getting to the point where you always have to ask, “Who CAN you trust anymore”?  GREAT video!  Thank You!",
Bring jakes voice back,
“Where is JA?” Pretty much sums up the fyre festival,
"If we want Jake to change, we shouldn't like, comment or watch these videos. I know I am doing 2 of those things right now, but I still have a little bit of hope left for Jake, but in my eyes he's just become a greedy capitalist. I'm definetly unsubbing. I will probably still watch the videos, but if nothing changes in a couple of months, I'll stop watching this fucker.",
"Ah fu** off, Jake Tran, you're the EA of Youtube",
I  want to know his side of the story. Like why I go that bad ? What really happened by his view.,
Ooh I knew this story from the tent picture alone!,
Listen pleighboi go back to narrating your own videos,
literally the Cayo Perico heist from GTA,
Tech window,
love the videos... I gotta get that 5$ to join!,
This is probably the worst narrator you hired,
“Effrey Jesptein”  you mean Jeffrey Epstein,
"I think it’s hilarious, fuck all those rich, entitled assholes.",
"not gonna lie feel like this channel has peaked, and we’re watching it’s slow descent, jake ignoring his fans sends a clear message & how almost every downfall of youtube channels begins",
The content of Jake Trans YouTube channel is enough to make the average Joe loose their mind.,
Your welcome:),
"Ja rule another thieve 

Att: Epstein Maxwell Vatican Friends",
"Jake Tran describing the literal definition of a ponzie scheme - ""which kind of sounds like a ponzie scheme""
Me - You don't say",
"JAKE please bro, please start narrating your videos again because that’s why we are here, we started watching your videos with YOU not your team (no offense) this is YOUR channel, Jake Tran is the brand but he’s not in most of his videos :( come back bro",
"as a long time follower i wonder what is ""skryb"" :D
Can you make a video about the newest Crypto scamming company from uk scammed $200m from Turkish citizens",
"Lol, at the end of the video he said ""Effery jepstein""",
How tf do these men get money to even try this shit?,
What is with all these YouTube's shilling for centralized exchanges when it comes to crypto currencies? You should be using Decentralised applications like Uniswap or DYDX to trade crypto not some exchange.  Centralization is antithetical to decentralized finance do decentralized finance which is what crypto currency is. Anybody arguing for centralized entities to come in to the decentralized space is a bad actor.,
"Hasn't the bitcoin bubble burst it might go up in value again.. I don't know why the web seems really cleaned up by all the 3 letter agencies.. Wasn't it really invented to buy pure forms of narcotics from the beginning
They sent most of the owners of the site and biggest vendors to prison",
It was cheese slices on wheat bread!! Get it right!! Lol,
Reminds me of a video from HSTLR with 15.1K subscribers... could be a coincidence but seems strange you would come up with the same topic only 16 days later,
Cayo perico vibes in the first quarter of the video lol,
Fxxk your titles dude,
"I've watched the Netflix and Hulu documentaries multiple times. I just love seeing these entitled ""influencers"" (aka spoiled brats) get royally screwed over. Ron Funches hit the nail on the head ""...that's just Darwinism at its finest.""",
15:50 if you want to find out what happened in the end. First 15 mins have been repeated through a ton of other articles/vids already.. good content though 👍🏼,
I bet everything was going smooth until 50 cent felt like being petty and bought all the actual tents,
They felt like Mexicans crossing the border illegally,
Billy is exactly the kind of dude I hate.,
I thought it might have just been me being underwhelmed with the content as of late but the comments def confirm that this channel has peaked and whatever is left ain’t worth staying around for. Unsubscribe. Take care everyone!,
HE IS OUT BUT PEOPLES MONEY GONE,
"Expectations vs reality...
Hmmm... effrey jeppstein..",
And yet everyone buys into the government scam and most the religion too,
Imagine you're working at the American Embassy in the Bahamas and all of a sudden dozens of your countrymen show up who look like they've been human-trafficked there.,
"I mean with tickets prized at 1000, what were you expecting?",
Put the documentaries on rumbull,
"I really don’t think anyone cares about this festival 6 years after it failed. Countless documentaries and media coverage. Old news. 

Can we get a relevant topic?",
"please make your titles more descriptive, like they used to be previously. please use the title to describe your video instead of making it ambigous and click baity",
"Fyre Festival was so bad that it became the go-to comparison for any massively cringeworthy failure, although ""Titanic"" is still the best descriptor of anything tragic.",
"Sol

so those artists are thieves?",
Jake Tran coming through with another banger... Thank you,

"I’ll be damned, 14:25-14:35 this is the kind of thing I love about Blink-182 and the type of people they are.",
Can’t get enough of this dumpster fyre.,
Praise God,
Someone need to make a Jake Tran style video about Jake Tran peddling all these investment apps,
"Jake, keep doing your thing bro! Content is top tier! It's a shame I can barely read through comments anymore because it's just people complaining about titles and sponsors........if you are a long time fan, why do you give af what the title is!? And he is not forcing you to do anything with the ads. As a matter of fact, he is doing you a favor by putting them in the video so you can skip instead of youtube ads that you can't skip. I wish these comments would fucking stop so we can see ACTUAL comments that have to do with the video. (I realize the irony as this comment has nothing to do with the video. I know people butt hurt by this will be rushing to point that out)",
"Jake, your videos are amazing but you have made changes (some quite recently) that are seriously affecting the quality of your content. 

- Your advertisements are predatory and not safe for people new to crypto. You gotta advertise, but please pick some better advertisers.
- Your titles and thumbnails give very little context to what the video is about. Personally this makes me want to see the video less. I've found myself skipping your videos recently cause I have no idea what it's about. 
- Why arnt you narrating your videos anymore? Your fans want to hear from you not a voice actor. 

I'm guessing you have recently outsourced alot of your content. It really shows",
Hey make sure i win before you stop the Instagram giveaway 😂😂🥸,
86th,
Give the locals they're props we put in elbow grease.it wasn't apparent it was a weird time in my life.,
Old news 🙄🤦‍♂️,
Just the fact that he spelled Fire Festival with a Y should have been a red flag,
That’s what you call dummy people 🤦‍♂️,
They can't catch everyone....let the buyers beware.      Ice holes...there's a axe for every seat.   FU46,
Nice to see the rich idiots struggle for a moment. Something most in the world experience all the time or at least 2x a month. I remember this.,
8000 Suckers lol,
Not financial advice,
Always shilling that resettable crypto Ponzi scheme aren’t ya.,
Love the content as always but you gotta get your intern a new mic... Please,
"Jake I love you channel but you gotta stop with the “most evil ……” Bc you’re literally turning into turn of the 21st century CNN. CNN lost its views and reliability by constantly saying “BREAKING NEWS” in the early 2000s and on. Your channel is gonna keep growing but you need to go back to your grass roots and give us less click baity titles and you need to stop decreasing you’re production quality. Something about you last 3 videos has me worried about your channel and where it’s going. Also is your audience we really only wanna
Hear your voice and no else that’s in your crew. We subscribed to Jake Tran not “Jake Tran and friends with clickbaity titles",
The one thing that you shouldn't care about being demonitised about is when it comes to JEPs list,
I never get tired of hearin about this scumbag and the disaster that was Fyre Festival,
wack,
Ahhh yes I’d like to see 7 BILLION people sign up to your shit and see the company pay out 700 Billion fuckin dollars.,
“Just 6 years” 6 years is actually a very long sentence for what he did. If you could make a lot of money scamming people why wouldn’t you.,
What a scam,
I woulda sued him and the celebrities that promoted it,
68k views and only 4k likes ;) speaks for itself,
Why the hell wasn't Ja Rule convicted?,
"Jajajajajajaja 

Jenner Bieber another's hunter hooker's Jutsu


Jajajjajajajajaj",
Recycling is good not with YouTube content,
I remember this. I watched a documentary last year. It was one of the biggest hoax and the the people that really suffered where the locals that were promised payment for all their labor and was paid nothing,
Everyone complaining about Jake selling out and advertising scam's need to understand that he needs to make money too and you're getting good free content so stop complaining.,
Bring back the old Jake Tran,
"I really, really am glad some spoilt rich brats and celebrities wasted so so so much money. Having to mill around like all the other plebs, sleeping in a tent, oh the travesty,  with no concierge oh boo hoo. I'm glad they got ripped off, that's how most of us feel I guess or probs just me lol. I don't care, can't tolerate minted people who haven't earned it themselves.",
I'm not mad this even happened,
Efery jeffistin 🤨 who is that 😂,
i. Trust capital seems fishy just like the fyre festival lol,
"“Jake I love your videos but, …” 

Ouch. It’s sad to see a creator lose grip on his audience.",
Clearly the money and fame got to Jake and he will end up just like the people he talked about in this video,
First,
"Total scam, that ""fyre""",
"I low key was laughing at all these pension kids ""suffering""",
"Effrey Jeppstein purchased a $250,000 VIP ticket for Fyre Festival",
"As an old subscriber, it’s sad to me to see how quickly the quality of this channel has dropped relative just to even a year ago! Jake, I really hope you try to look back into your past to see what your subscribers liked and enjoyed, to help you succeed in your future! We all want to see you do well man!",
"You and your team do great work.  I enjoy your straight to the point documentaries they are very not opinion based.  Just facts.  I have no clue why they even have ""The News"" anymore.  That isnt real journalism like the stuff you provide Jake.",
can you make a video about how the supreme court has sided with big business throughout history especially in the lochner era and recently in the citizen united case,
"ask those he scammed, he didnt get enough......from the investors to the people who got stranded
he also started a new grift while waiting for trial, selling tickets to thing he didnt have......",
the netflix documentary was so funny!!,
"Jake please try titles without the clickbait….. you don’t even need it…. I’ve personally recommended this channel to 3 people who subscribed and watch regularly now. That’s due to the quality of the Older content and less suspicious sponsor Ads. 

I’m hoping this channel doesn’t fall off. I don’t mind the outsourcing of VO personally, that’s the only way you would be able to push content out but please hear us out on the other issues",
I feel like if we knew the name of the team member talking it be better.,
Will jake Tran narrate his own video this time? Lets find out!,
Nice vid,
"the jake tran setup:
Man with red eyes in thumbnail
Some sort of “evil”, “I’m shocked” “cover up” “unknown” “Not gonna like this”",
Funny how everyone was praising your style of content when you were peaking… now it’s really gone downhill with you jus tryna cash out on scammy apps promoting to your fans. Who got you here. Even your titles lack any effort. Comfy now eh? 🤣,
"Exclusive for the masses hahahahah... oh people, never learn",
I love this. Just goes to show that most heavily marketed things are all hype. All the hype driven kids learned a lesson. You don’t need insane marketing if you have a good product.,
"I heard of this from ""Internet Historian"", and boy is he one of most underrated content creators of all time.",
"I love Jake Tran videos and all, but I can't help but find the fact that he says in the beginning of the video after the sponsorship segment where he is talking about some $1000 Instagram giveaway he mentions fake Instagram accounts and that he will never tell you to invest, right after telling you to invest in crypto through his sponsor. Kinda funny. This isn't the first time this happened, either. Also, people are clearly upset with his vague clickbait titles and thumbnails and him using other narrators. However, I don't blame him for using narrators as many other similarly sized YouTube channels have many employees in some capacity, often editing. Sadly, I don't think that Jake will have much more success if these things don't change as he's pissing off his old audience. I really do like Jake's content and style so it hurts to see this happen.",
¿Do we have to eliminate the Plutocratic terrorist and his microphone artist allies?,
first,
The Fyre Festival has been beaten to death already...,
Internet historian covered this so much better,
"Who else laughed their ass off when this shit broke? Seriously, I laughed so hard when i heard this. From the first commercial I thought it was a scam.",
Unsubscribed cause this channel’s going to shits,
"Hermosa elección 18KISSX.UNO

22:22 Son unos de los mejores conciertos, no puede ir pero de tan solo verlos desde pantalla, se que estuvo sorprendente zifn 🖤 15:55 Son unos de los mejores conciertos 🖤",
effrey jepstein,
Love the irony of this sponsor. Also when people say “never a better time to invest in crypto” then “not financial advice” as you advise to invest in crypto with the sponsor. 🙄,
it feels like he uses his voice to make you think hes narrating the vid but only uses it to make you hear his sponsor its a kind of disingenuous.,
I like your videos but can you do more for titles and thumbnails related to main topic,
Another gem thanks jake,
This s old..... Netflix got this covered already....,
10:04 - 10:08: Did anyone else catch the vocal transition from typical Jake Tran into like some evening TV newscaster narrating true crime aftermaths :'P?,
"Yes he will pay everyone back using other peoples money, he just told everyone he starting a new ponzi scheme, to pay back million this one is going to be a very big ponzi scheme",
Wow I saw another documentary video like this about a month ago,
Follow the white rabbit 🐰🥕,
"Who did the narration for you, Jake? He's quite good.",
"1. Makes content about scammers
2. Shills for crypto
3. Profit",
"Whats with the failed app fyre from billy? 
Watch the Dokus  about him",
Lmao keeping my money! Can easily find out about anybody anywhere.,
"Make sure everyone goes and follows Jake on his IG Account to be in the running for his 1k cash prize!! (MAKE SURE TO WATCH THE WHOLE VIDEO FOR MORE DETAILS!!)

ALSO MAKE SURE TO SUBSCRIBE TO HIS YOUTUBE CHANNEL and MAKE SURE TO HIT THE LIKE BUTTON & ALSO TO SHARE ALL HIS VIDEO'S!!! 😅...  Please & Thank You Everyone!👻",
HSTLR did a video on this a couple weeks ago. This Fyre fraudster guy needs to be exposed.,
When TF did pleb status rate a few hundred dollars for a concert ticket.  GTFO.,
When rich kids from Instagram find out what life feels like for others😂,
Then his dad made fun of it on Family Guy- so they did make money after all lmao,
Please unsubscribe.,
"Oldschool Jake Tran was legit nice.  And NOW? Nope, click bait/ad bs.  Disliking every video I watch from here on out.",
Was it the pre-shoot of squid game,
"I am floored by how much content you're able to put out on a regular basis. Not only that, but it always manages to be engaging, interesting, and high quality. Keep doing what you do, Jake.",
Hmm,
The party was so unreal....really unreal.😏,
A fool and their money,
Dirty peasents deserve nothing but a pig's orgy in the dirt  I AM ON BILLY'S SIDE !!!! GO BILLY,
This new guy's voice is soooo boring!,

"you’re late, jake, people have been talking about fyre festival for years",
Internet historian covered this years ago,
"I rather have you put less videos out there than having someone else narrating them. Jake you are the identity of this channel it has (or it had?) your style, your voice and your name.
You can't just transfer it to someone else and expect it to work.
Plus, can we talk how cynical is it from you to constantly talks about scams and shady companies but still promoting businesses. How can we know they are different?
and today's title? you said nothing about Fyre just that a guy lied to people and oh that's sad
did he got to jail? or anyrthing? you switched to Jeffrey...",
Fire festival did blew up🔥,
#wewantthelist love your videos man thank you,
"Jake, love your videos and everything, but I'm tired of the click-baity titles and I'm also tired of hearing somebody else on your videos. I'll keep skipping until you're back or down voting, whichever I think about first. I'm sorry, but we've asked you for weeks to be the main voice of your videos.",
"I decided it, i have watched every video on this channel, but i'm not gonna watch another one with a clickbait title with no info for the video",
Did the narrator change after the Crypto Promo or is it just me? 😂,
"I love Jake and the documentaries he puts out but man these clickbait titles are wearing on me. Jake we get it, you can't believe that people are evil. Get some more informative (less clickbait) titles.",
"Lose the camera click sound effects, at best have it once or twice. Can't listen to this while going to sleep.",
I love it when Jake calls people variants of poors,
"For the sake of feedback, this topic has been done to death. Keep providing content on things that people don’t know much about.",
"He'll spend the rest of his life paying the people he scammed, because he is a ""man of his word"". Really...🙄",
"Meanwhile worlds greatest 
dance-festival is going strong next 2weekends aka Tomorrowland (Boom-Belgium) 🤙",
"Glowing red eyes have pretty much become a bullish on Bitcoin thing... and you promote iTrust Capital... so it seems weird you wouldn't know that, but it's on like all your thumbnails for villains instead. Lotta mixed signals. Not much context for your viewers on investing either (who might dive in over their heads), and it seems like a weird kind of ad for your channel.",
One of the biggest jebaits I’ve seen.,
What is operation chaos?,
Jake best journalist in the world!,
Just the sight of some entitled Little Rich girl sitting on that island crying because she didn't get flown out there in a private jet and the festival was a sham makes me happy and filled with warmth.... Lmao 😂😂😂 the tears of my adversaries sustain me....,
GREAT VIDEO JAKE,
Nice drop at the end,
"Investor: ""who's your branding guy?!""
Douche: ""ja rule...""
*Rejected*",
I appreciate the effort and quality that Jake puts into these but I am all too familiar with all these stories already. Literally every video you've put out recently is on an old topic that's been covered to death. I would love to see some deeper dives into topics that nobody else is paying attention to. There's tons of them out there.,
Unsubbed. His content has always been a little sketch with the shilling but plugging the crypto scam that steals your retirement fund is too much.,
So what did he get????,
"To do an event of the size Fyre festival, was supposed to be, you had to start planning a minimum of 12 months beforehand. They usually plan it several years before they plan on doing the event. They instead tried to do it in around 12 weeks, with a group of people who had no idea how to set up a festival. Most of them worked for the company making the star booking app Fyre festival was supposed to launch. It was always doomed to fail. 🤦‍♂️🤣",
Honestly don’t understand all of the Jake Tran hate. This dude is simply scaling up his business and producing a Netflix style documentary video EVERY 3 days. Stop complaining. It’s called businesses. He’s scaling…,
your choice in sponsors really calls your integrity into question my dude,
why do you shill crypto so much ?,
He did something you won't get away with. Scamming the rich. If he scam the poor he would be free,
"unfortunately jakes ""documentaries"" has fallen dramatically in quality, a cheap montage of other people videos, a lousy sponsorship deal, and a cheap voice actor... I miss the old videos where things were genuine...",

Jake Tran... my guy.  Your ad is exactly what you claim to hate so much.,
"I respect Jake for his content.

But him doing promotions for every possible crypto exchange app and stating it's claims to get himself paid over the videos regarding scams and scandals is a very clear example of how the content consumers need to be very aware of what these influencers are asking you to buy or opt in, doesn't matters what their content or their narratives have been on the social media, in the end they wanna get paid and they barely give a damn about millions of people watching them.",
Wtf man.. what happened to all the titles recently?,
Good content and informative,
"As always, nice video Jake; I would add a few details 'cuz I believe that McFarland's attempt to make a great festival was genuine, but he was a horrible planner who ""tried to bite more than he could chew"".

1 - The island he claimed be ""owned by Escobar"" actually belonged to the Medellin Cartel ex-associate Carlos Lehder, which he used to smuggle ""ice"" to the U.S in the 80s.
2 - By coincidence (at least it seems to be), the Exuma Regatta, a annual boat race, was happening in the island right at the same weekend of the Festival; all the hotels and resorts were booked with tourists who came to see the race, so the staff had to deal with desperate youngsters invading the property in the search for food and somewhere to sleep.
3 - An Israeli expert in big events was hired after many organizers dumped McFarland due to the conditions; he warned that such a festival would require a whole year to plan and build, so he asked McFarland to postpone the event in six months, but he refused. Four weeks before the date, he bailed out after realizing the dumpster fire he was getting into (good move); even after that, McFarland didn't gave up, just saying to his staff ""let's do like the legends!"".
4 - Ja Rule also bailed out right in the same day of the festival, he posted in his social media account that he had ""nothing to do with it""; perhaps he trusted McFarland so blindly, that he couldn't see he was a such bad manager.
5 - An interview made with a few buyers afterwards revealed that many of them would buy new tickets if there was a 2nd attempt to make the festival happen.",
There is a Netflix documentary about this scam,
"Jake you need to do your own videos bro, this robot sounding mf is getting annoying",
Hmmmm.... Making videos about scams and promoting crypto things same time? Feels fishy to me,
always brings a smile to my face to see the wealthy scammed like a common person,
The irony of doing a video on a fraudster while pushing an ad for crypto...,
Dumpster Fyre,
Man the start is reminding me of El Rubio and Cayo perico,
Jenner Bieber another's hunter hooker's Jutsu,
So ja rule was also a scammer.,
Could you do a document on the east Asian financial crisis of 1997,
The could've just rented a cruise ship for 2 weeks for 10 million dollar,
So I've been watching this video 45 minutes and you still yet to give me any information that I didn't already have on this topic your music in the videos is way too loud just talk tell us what you want to tell us and on to the next one you're pushing an ad you're just as fake as everyone else,
he wasn't that bad,
Netflix already covered this brah.,
"Jake, I love your videos, but the clickbaity titles are really annoying, and the fact that you accept literally any kind of sponsor doesn't help",
Festival people suck,
Guns out tounges out,
That shutter sound is too loud. Louder than narrarator ..the one we never got introduced to loo,
"Billy also learned that there is a sucka born every minute,",
I miss Jake voicing his own videos and not just the intro/ads.,
E,
Hilarious that rich people got hosed. Guess everyone is capable of being fooled,
Interesting channel but it feels like it’s one step from being super sold out and a money machine.. the slippery slope of YouTube gets all the humble ppl and turns them into greedy soldouts,
"Ha,ha! Rich people had to suffer for once",
"I dont get  how ghislaine gets 20 years, when they give people who have a lb of weed that/",
"Can't believe he steals over $26 million and gets only 6 years in prison, while all some people do is smoke marijuana and are put away for over a decade",
I watch Jake train not just for the content but for the narration.  If I watch one more video without an Asian man's accent I'm unsubscribing,
how much research do you do to ensure the legitimacy of sponsors?,
"You are making documentaries on scams but yet, you have no problem advertising and recommending a scam?",
"""In late 2016, something stranged happen""
00:01",
Such lovely and nice videos 🔥🔥🔥💯💯... Keep up the good work Jake,
A lot of these people got what they deserved for their unrelenting desire to chase clout and need to be “exclusive” with everything.,
The marketing was fyre tho.,
"before i watch this video, what's the name of the fraudster so i don't waste 20 minutes finding out his name from this title",
"So a guy was in their room, told them it's a free for all, and they just... accepted it?
I'd have thrown the guy out, stating that it was mine and I had the documentation to prove it.",
I was literally going to ask if you changed his name through demonetization then you said it.,
"Just disliked and unsubscribed, fuck your shitty titles",
Ja rule another thieve criminal,
How many more documentaries about the Fyre Festival do we need?,
Thank you for finally making a video about something I've actually heard of rather than banana republics,
Great prank!,
"My grandfather always says ""if it's bitter don't immediately spits it, if it's sweet don't immediately swallows it""
because something bitter just might be actually a medicine for your own good, and something sweet just might be bad for you

and Jake maybe (just maybe) you will make video about one of your sponsor in the future, i hope you'd be careful bro, your goodwill is being put on the line there",
Now Ja Rule shilling crypto and NFT scams,
Kindly use specific titles,
I think everyone involved got what they deserved honestly 🤷‍♂️,
I really wish that the channel playlists would be updated with videos that have been released within the last year…,
"These clickbaits and scummy sponsers aren't doing good for your channel, no one likes to watch rushed videos pumped out asap just because you want more sponsors",
"unsubbed, this channel is going down the drain with scam promotions and pawning off videos to other narrator",
17:33. Whoooo?,
It's actually a wonder that nobody died. lol,
Bro cant smile,
At least Jake still does the ads himself.,
the truth always been rewritten by $,
Drop less videos Jake,
"all these youtubers doing docs on scammers and then pushing these ""get rich with crypto"" aps that turn out to be fraudulent within a few years. makes sense to me why be skeptical?",
Vayo perico real life reference 🙄,
"Please do this next:

*Activision Blizzard: The Most Evil Business in the World*",
imagine making a video about scams and then promoting crypto as a retirement option,
I miss Jake's narration,
"Hmmmmm, seems like you're up against the ropes Jake. Maybe some bad decision? idk. Hoping and praying for you. Really starting to lose interest.",
Yet another video of yours I won’t be watching just because of this title and thumbnail. Listen to your audience dude. It’s off putting to literally everyone.,
"The irony of promoting a crypto scam to your followers while claiming to be the honest mam who exposes others scams, unhinged.",
"Ah yes, Fyre Fest. The disaster so amazing that there were promises of a second one.",
Did u just call me a peasant?,
Lmao what an april fool's joke,
"I've never heard about this festival, I guess I'm fraud-proof",
OH that's why you're mispronouncing his name ha,
I’m glad the audience has finally woken up to this channel. Jake… you switched up,
Any relation to Seth?,
Thanks for bringing the titles back,
I already know all these details because of Internet Historian but that doesn't stop me from watching this one.,
Make your titles less clickbaity and take better quality sponsors. That's all,
All I know is that Luxary can and is sold as a commodity that everyone wants. That’s the crazy part to me,
Dang.... You finally make Fyre Fest video. 📹,
Great documentary but I was expecting Ephrey Jepstein to be part of the story 😒,
Netflix already has a more in dept documentary on this. Was kind of hopping for additional commentary/footage not included in that one - disappointed.,
It was a true Fyre,
"Woah, early here.!",
"It's worth mentioning that they did actually rent out Norman's Cay, but the owners expressly forbid them from mentioning Pablo Escobar, which Billy started doing almost immediately, causing the contract to be cancelled.",
Fucking sell out,
hi jake tran,
I think this got referenced in Henry danger,
Dumpster fire festival more like,
"Meh, netflix covered It years ago",
"(The experience is beyond words)
One word: dissapointment",
Scuzzball middlemen. But also I don't feel sorry for any of these filks . All the partners are scammers all thw promotions teams scammers . Even the artists involved scammers . And as far as the people buy8ng tickets fir this . I remember th8nking how awful this sounded before it happened.  They got what they paid for,
"I think billy just underestimated the time it would actually take to build that kind of fest, and the costs too. Imo, it might not be a deliberate fraud, does billy have a history of conning? I mean maybe he just underestimated this project and made a big mistake that had a domino effect. 

What do you guys think?",
Terrorist Giselle Maxwell Vatican Friends Royalty,
Y’all should check out internet historians video about fyre festival,
"Does this mean that Ja Rule is technically a fraudster too? 🤔

Also, this whole debacle feels like a giant human trafficking scheme. 🤦 Lol",
Bro listen to ur fans,
The fire festival sounds like that one kid we all know at school that lies about everything from his family being rich to his uncle being a famous rapper and too many elaborate things for me to mention in this comment... Lmao 😂😂😂,
"I was honestly just as happy to see all these rich spoiled kids get fucked over for once. Lol their bags of luggage probably had like $30,000 worth of clothing in them.",
"Jake tran: I wont ask you to invest or have money.

The ad: Investing and money.",
"With 27mil I could of arranged something awesome and still profited, That dudes just a piece of shit taking off with all their $

Did Billy or Ja whatever not know it was a scam from the beginning 🤔",
"Intro stating he'll tell you to invest, immediately followed up by him asking us to invest. Hmm....",
Ja Rule be shady... Wasn't charged?,
How dumb can you be,
"I saw this channel's downfall coming a mile away. We all know Fyre Festival. There's a dozen videos about it. This guy is scraping the bottom of the barrel for conspiracies to prove, and is becoming one himself with the crypto-crap he's promoting. Congrats, Jake, you're a mediocre channel.",
Thieves,
1k for 2 weeks in the Bahamas is an amazing deal,
Jake is slowly but surely becoming the people he make documentaries about. rip it was good while it lasted,
I have no sympathy for any of the twads who brought tickets. Rich kids having a hard time is great needs to happen more often.,
"My guy said ""white bread"", you mean brown bread......",
Will you at least apologize to any viewers when they lose everything with your sponsor?,
You have. make a video on Pelosi's stock investment fortune.,
Billy has got the most punchable face ever.,
Fuck this clickbaity nonsense and your crypto scam,
"Just starting watching this. I really hope Jake mentions the real hero of Fyre - Andy King. What he was willing to do for water will be remembered for generations to come 😂😂😂😂

Just to add I love Jake but his sponsors are not someone I would ever invest with. Jake - Accepting sponsors blindly will impact your integrity. Your whole thing is the dark side of money and power. Yet you shill junk projects. Just keep what you doing and be more selective qith your sponsors. You will achieve natural growth and $$ will follow. However, keep going down this route  you will lose integrity and your channel will drop heavy. You have got something very few YouTube ppl have - the trust of your audience. Do not throw that away for a quick buck. Just my opinion but you do you bro",
"You know there are parties like that held already.
They are called cruises",
Awesome video! Please do one for the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia where they used Depleted Uranium to bomb civilians!,
This is a perfect allegory for the State.,
I remember seeing the ad- I thought there is no way this is going to go well because of the logistics issues- And then everything fell apart-,
We need different titles but still love the content and info.,
Effry jepstien,
*Jeffrey Epstein* WTF?,
I remember seeing ads for fyre fest and when I seen ja rule I instantly knew it was a scam,
Jake is not even narrating the whole video anymore...like wtf.,
Jake I ain’t gonna lie your content back in early 2021 or late 2020 whatever when I subbed to u was top tier quality content but your vids now all say “ThIs Is ThE mOsT eViL tHiNg” etc etc and idk man your vids just don’t feel the same,
so he will come up with a new scheme and take that money and arrange another ice festival,
your new vids suck,
Jake I love your content but this was not it comparing your older content. This was too much of a TLDR of what happened at fyre fest. Next and Hulu are much better quality. I recommend those docs over this executive summary.,
Funny. Oh they got they're inclusivity! Lol,
"Jake: I would never ask for money or invest
Jake 34 seconds later: *invest*",
"The biggest fraudsters are the ""influencers"" who promote anything that pays them well. No sense of responsibility.",
"Trump:



Your Fyred!",
I remember watching this on Netflix,
"wait this dont sound like jake, where's jake ?",
I don't know seems like you're scamming something if you want to see or hear about the bin Laden papers just type it in YouTube and it comes right up you don't have to pay for anything he doesn't have access to nothing that's not already pubic information already don't be fooled by the hype,
Why do you call him effry jeppstein? It’s that easy to get demonetized that you can’t even say his name?,
Boots analítica intrusion Technocracy Algorithms = Epstein Maxwell Vatican Friends Royalty,
"I'm no accountant, but one thing I think when I see the advertisement is, is it even feasible, one night in Bahamas is already expensive as hell, that already excluding the drink and food, it is shady as hell",
Ain't paying y'all ish 😂 but I do like some of the content you drop on YouTube sir 👍,
5:45 EW! Dude. You’ve narrated the first 5 minutes and 45 seconds. You can finish the remaining 10-15 minutes of narration. Your videos are excellent but the lack of narration replaced with some lame boring voice is absolutely disgusting. Your once excellent videos have plummeted in quality. This video would be 10x better if you would just spend 10-15 minutes finishing the narration yourself….,
"Ah, A fan of Internet historian i see",
Since when did jake tran start voicing only the first part of his videos? I dont like this decline in content :(,
15:01 ha ha you wish it was rain....,
"Ah Fyre Festival,
I remember hearing about this from Internet Historian",
Great 👍 video,
Jizz-Lane Maxwhell? Nice bro. Nice ^_^ 17:15,
Why is nobody talking about how dr. Fauci ran an experiment on dogs that had bugs eat their heads when they were still alive and how he and bill gates tired to Thanos snap the rest of the world with COVID with the help of the Chinese government,
"Thats why I doesn't go to any trip., .
Home sweet home 🏡🏠😘.",
"Talking about scammers and promoting crypto.... What can go wrong... Well if you want to loose your savings, go ahead!",
"Jake just narrate eveything yourself man, at the point now where I just click off the video when the narrator comes. There's something interesting in your way of storytelling that cant be replaced",
"*The Internet Historian chuckles, amused.*",
"Damn yall really gotta say
""Effrey Jepstien"". Youtube do be facked",
How do you upload so often?!?!,
"""from kendall jenner to hailey bieber"" so six and half a dozen?",
Stop with the clickbait titles fuck it’s annoying,
"""This fraudster got what he deserves!"" 

*$100 guru grift in description*",
cayo perico lmao,
when did he become a sellout,
"Dang Jake it’d be cool if you would at least tell your audience whether you’re ever going to actually narrate a video yourself again. Most of us probably subbed/joined to hear you. The fact people have been getting top comments giving you suggestions and they’re just kind of ignored is kind of frustrating as a viewer. Just give your viewers some sort of answer whether you think they’ll like it or not. Like shit dude, even the $5 a month channel members don’t even get to hear you narrate a video.",
Plebs! Peasants! LMAO,
Brought here by Tate the cobra hustler,
The greatest story ever told,
Finally a bunch of rich people get to feel like getting scammed,
Jake's voice only!,
Sorry man you can't beat Internet Historian.,
“Jizz-lane maxwell”,
Who was supplying the drugs though?,
"Jake you forgot to upload to Odysee, this episode is not on there",
Ja is enough to know it’s fake .,
FIRST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,
"The perfect time to buy crypto???!!! You should be ashamed,  fcking pathetic",
Almost six minutes into your video you actually got to the real video. Cut the ads dude. Or at least cut them back. If I wanted to sit through this much ads in a 20 minute video I would just watch tv...Fffffuck.,
All these sketchy ads in the latest videos removes all trust and integrity from the content itself IMO,
"u really just used a different person to voice over for the whole 2nd half of the video and didnt even credit him, i see what ur doing making others work ur own buddy 😂 bro really took roberts greene advice to the tee",
You really need better titles I never know what I'm getting into,
"yeah,, ""Music"" Festival

smelly nasty place",
"Can you make a documentary on the collapse of C-Fi like Celsius, Voyager, etc.?",
"you are one fraudster yourself. For example your sponsors, those are mostly scams.",
Internet Historian made a much better video on the fyre festival.,
"This dude: I have some random dude that's done some shady stuff. I can add in some overly dramatic dialogue. There's only one thing missing....

Intern: ADD IN THE GLOWING RED EYES",
I fucking hate the new voice over guys,
there's already two different documentaries on this trainwreck... isn't that video a little bit superfluous?,
@Jake Tran have you done anything on (PHP) People helping people from Patrick of Valuentertainment?,
"That awkward moment when Jake video has less effort than Netflix ""documentary"" on that.",
"Hey Jake. I just found your channel. I have watched a LOT of you ""older"" videos in the last 2 days. I really liked them. But the new stuff.. Titles, thumbnails and other things people mention in their comments.. feel weird man. I am 100% not forcing you to change anything. Just saying there are people that will watch your vids even if youtube doesnt like them. ❤️",
Effery Jepstein?,
"17:10 sorry, one more time, Effrey Jepstein?",
"I don't believe epstein is dead. I think powerful people helped him fake his death. Now everybody's thinking he was killed, when instead truth is even worse. He is alive, while the whole world thinks that real conspiracy is that he didn't kill himself, but was murdered. What a genius plan. He must have had leverage over some very powerful people. I don't believe for a second that he didn't use that leverage against them so they would help him faking his death. Case closed. No ones is ever going to look for him, because everyones thinking he was 'killed'.",
"Imagine if this Billy dude had actually taken time to execute on delivering what he said his company would. Obviously profit/loss is part of business but once you have a customer that loves your product/service they'd keep coming back, and once business starts growing you can raise more and more to expand it further.

And if he would've executed it good imagine the livelihood it would have provided the locals in Bahamas. 

Two things to learn is there's defiantly a big market for music/event festivals and not to underestimate the power of social media marketing.",
"I would have never clicked on this video if I knew it was about Fyre. There was literally zero new info here. ""Research"", like what? Wathcing the netfliz documentary, using it's footage and adding a narration?
And at the end we got a preview for another hot topic ""Jeffrey Epstein"". I can't wait to get private access to that research effort!
I am a recent subscriber,
I am an imediate unsubscriber.",
"You are paying off your old audience, Jake. Don't let the success get to your death",
loving the surplus of great content. idk how you do it,
Dislike this video we want Jake,
Take a deep dive on cold war and it's consequences on Africa,
nah for real where's Jake to narrate these videos,
"You could have made the title of this video in the into the title of the YouTube thumbnail because they are written well without even the word ""Evil"".",
This channel sucks now it’s bad generic content basically clickbait now I like liked it so much I paid but it’s my last month and I’m out for good,
"Please stop with the clickbait titles, we all love your content, not your clickbait",
I still don’t understand why it’s necessary to switch to a different narrator.,
"You hate to see it. Maybe Jake will turn the channel around soon, I’m not holding my breath though.",
What a brilliant scam...,
Honestly most things are to good to be true,
IH did it better,
"Start such a festival for real.
THEN NUKE THE ISLAND!",
I love how he calls them plebs - peasants lmao omg,
He didn't got what he deserved,
Rich kids get screwed over the end... nobody cares that your 5k festival was a scam lol,
"need more documentaries , more long and on mainstream topics like these. dope video as always!",
Stop the vague/click bait titles 🙏,
"This is what happens when you think that Woodstock was just another concert...
If you want luxury,you deserve exactly what you got. Exactly like the rot that gets together in Myconos,Greece or Mallorca to show off their undeserved wealth.",
In German it means Yes Rule.,
"So let me get this str8…. their plane ran out of ⛽️🤣. AND people would’ve known who Ja Rule was, the f*ckery lmao",
sounds like a scam. you can grow your crypto by 20% a year but when its loosing 50% value the growing part means nothing.,
I dont know Jake... With all these scams that you advertise you might have to make a video on yourself soon.,
make it cheaper then ill consider,
"Jake, yet again proving when you start to get viewers en mass your ethics regarding sponsors will go out the window. I can respect the fact he really doesn't give a fuck as long as we watch and the advertiser cheque clears.

While he has shady ads and shit titles I'm gonna watch but I'll dislike 100%",
"Finally you listened to the TOP COMMENT OF ACTUALLY MAKING YOUR OWN VIDEOS. jeeez

Edit; then I heard the other guy start talking not even halfway through,  officially UNSUBBED from your capitalized garbage

Couldn't have happened to more deserving folks!,
"Fake it till you make it...
ITS THE AMERICAN WAY...!!!
THEY DESERVED IT...",
"Unsubscribed...
Reasons:
- Dubious advertisement
- different narrator in the videos(why make an appearance in the first minutes if we get stuck with someone else for the remaining 10 or 15 min? This ain't it😔)
- click-bait titles
- last but not least, all complains has been done before, but it seems to fall on deaf ears, nothing changes. 

I don't wish u bad things tho, the first videos were pretty good ,and thanks for that. Good luck and good bye👋",
The party was so unreal it never happened!,
Victimless crime bahahaha,
You’re not gaining nearly as many subs or likes because of these dick head titles,
"New viewer here but like, WOW. The video was well enough, if not on already tread ground. My concern are the MONEYGRABS. You make mention of 2 ways to directly give you funds and had 2 sponsors of frankly VARIANT quality, all for a 20 minute video!

Judging by your comments, that's not something you used to do. Willing to give another go but if they're all like this, I may just have to let this channel be. 😬",
"He charged far too little for what he was offering. 
Could’ve been an epic event.",
"It's been a great ride, but I'm leaving now. This channel has gone down the drain. Clickbait titles, lower quality content, even the new narrator that nobody likes. I miss the OG Jake, man. 
Peace, imma head out now. ✌🏾
EDIT:
From other comments I realise why this is probably happening. Jake knows we hate the changes, but he knows he can make more money by targeting a different audience from us, the ones he started with. Fair play to him.",
Never trust any muthafucka with a shit-eatin grin.,
effery jepstein? 17:33 😂,

At least he wasn't scamming poor people like our governing bodies. This guy is more noble than our government.,
That island is so dope why did they go a ruin it with a festival with a bunch of posers,
The sad thing are the garbage left behind and the local that not paid for their services,
You are moving too quick Jake. Too quick slow down.,
"""This is what youre actually supposed to be learning about in School and Uni"" LMAOO ur videos are interesting but don't get carried away Jake lmao",
I enjoy the content but i hate the shilling for sketchy companies,
"Guy: “Biggest scam in music industry!”
Also guy: “Buy the dip in crypto!”",
pieces of trash,
"I remember the Fyre Festival!! It was sad, but hilarious!",
Thank you for making this one I've always wanted to know what happened,
"I dont think investing in Crypto is great that the moment Jake, wasn't they a dive in stocks?",
Jake dgaf about his fans anymore and it’s kind of sad. He’s turning into the guys he makes videos about…,
Internet Historian already did that one,
2+2=5,
Effery Jepstein!! I almost died laughing!! 😭😂🤣😂,
kinda funny ngl,
Funny enough I was reading Paradise Lost before I was alerted about Jake's upload😜,
This narrarator aint as good as jake. Me no like,
Why is this guy and his monotone voice back,
Look up Andy King blowjob Netflix. Best story coming out of that dumpster fire.,
5 dollar a month? Lol,
I've watched this on Netflix multie times. Failure of the decade.,
"""Super Successful"" and Woodstock DO NOT go hand in hand. Financially it was as bad as Fyre if not worse. Bad comparison. Shows your lack of knowledge on the subject and dilutes your credibility.",
I remember this. Hilarious. Didn't feel bad for these people buying expensive tickets and coming to destroy the local environment. Only feel bad for the locals who had to deal with all the rich kids.,
"C'mon, it wasn't that bad.  It wasn't, ""...cheese slices on white bread."" That was wheat bread.",
"Your intro made me a lot less sympathetic to the people that got scammed. Was that intentional?
But the guy who did that is still a mayor a**hole. This isn't even his first scam and he screwed the workers, too. F*ck this guy.",
Effrey Jepstein 😂😂😂😂,
"Unsubbed. You have lost your way Jake Tran. All you do now is make shitty clickbait titles and let another narrator voice your vids. This is no longer “Jake Tran” youtube channel, just a random paid by Jake Tran to narrate his stuff.",
"we can barley say his name without getring demonetized

proceeds to say his name multiple times

lol",
Your voice is different hmmmmmmmm,
i love it when a man can duped and tricked so many rich snob and stole their money,
Jake stop shilling crypto‼️,
Sad to see your channel has started going down. You peaked too soon.,
I miss when Jake narrated his own videos,
Here to get one of the best documentaries.,
Engagement,
"Saying it's a good time to buy crypto because there's been a correction is naive at best, scam at worst.",
These crypto ads suck man. Your content is good but what the hell are these scammy ads.,
how much are these scams giving you that makes it worth it to scam your own audience,
"I went to a fyre fest themed bar and they had a tent, jail cell, the sad sandwiches, and the “ja rule” drink 🍹🤣",
Jake does an intro then one of his workers makes the rest of the video. This formula is getting old.,
Right bow is not a good time to invest lmao,
Are these videos no longer done by Jake? WTH?,
"saying ""Now is the best moment to invest into crypto"" and then "" i'm not an advisor"" ... yeah sure... then why say it's the best moment to invest if you're saying you're too stupid to say such stuff?",
"Trying to peddle every single questionable investment option on the market isn't doing much for your credibility. How about some RAID: Shadow Legends or BetterHelp ads while we're at it? What's that? You already did those? I'm baffled. I get that you have to finance this, but what you're doing is the definition of selling out.",
Glowing eyes channel,

Am I the only one who can tell that Jake doesn't even narrate his own videos,

"You are the fraudster here with your stupid 10 minutes ""ads"" faQing scumbag   fys dude.",
"All the money collected probably went to kendall,hadid and hailey for being in the promo 😂😂",

So he didn't get what he deserved in the end.,
Why your most of the videos feel like its incomplete? 😂,
sussess,
"Ok, I'll do it. The way he pronounces ""successful"".",
Sounds like a cult..,

There's already a Fyre Festival documentary on Netflix. And it's incredibly in depth.,
"Sorry Jake, this vid was a fail. No, he didn't get what he deserved, he's already out of jail only 4 years after he was sentenced!! This story was already well covered & you barely added any new information. Done with the clickbait titles, done with your channel. ✌🏿",
50th,
Oh that's so amazing the thought of all those little rich kids just stuck on a desert island makes me smile from ear to ear🤣,
I truly feel bad for the workers who got put in a terrible situation and never got a dime.,
Jake check your dm's on ig !!!!,
Dude tried to become El Rubio,
I don't care about the party goers but the workers not getting paid is sad as heck,
Listen to your fans man…before you have none left,
"Narrate your own shit

The feedback is clear",
Clickbait,
Bending the truth Elon musk comes to mind.,
Cool,
This will forever be one of my favorite scams. Watching all these silver spoon kids get knocked down was hilarious,
I'm fine with these rich idiots getting ripped off... I'd like to see more of it.. Also is this the best time to be promoting crypto? It is scam as well.  I'm hoping more rich people get ripped off again.. I thought you had a conscience about these things..,
This documentary is shown first on Netflix,
"awsome just what these ""high end"" narcissists deserved, a fricking cheese sandwich! they should be scammed way more often!",
Baldur's Gate 2,
"My guy immediately talks shit about half-life 2 

Booooyyyyyyy",
My man forgot about Bioshock 2,
I absolutely love Hades. Never was a fan of those kind of games before but I love mythology so I tried it out and I’ve cleared it like 12 times. I agree 100% for 10/10,
"honestly i can't think of anything more fun than a thumbtack, so of course i gotta make that a perfect 10/10, nothing can really beat it in it's replay-ability and timelessness, honestly think it made my childhood.",
Minecraft and WoW are definitely a pair of 10/10 games,
1:00 Valorant's classic pistol sounds so much worst,
Great editing,
I've never heard of stay before wtf is that,
No playing half life today for the first time is amazing because you know how old it is and you can see how it’s the OG. Big A your just wrong about half life,
Atriold,
"I feel like giving a thumb tack a 10/10 is a very brandon ""no pain, no gain"" ewing thing to do. Just my personal opinion.",
Idk if he’s played them but I think both Undertale and Bloodborne belong on that list too. I would also replace Ocarina of time with BOTW.,
Breath of the Wild?,
"True. HL2 is a well polished tech demo with a great story. I wont go as far as you on the gun sounds. But yea. I died on shit that doesn't exist, got stuck reload, got lost for tooo long on that first play through. But still go back through for nostalgia and stumble on mods to this day. Crossbow bolts are still crisp btw. No 10/10 because we never even got a real finish to the Eps and no HL3. Mario 64. Yes - Still play a lot of N64 games and yall called a lot of the good 1s. (Snowboardkids/1080, Diddy Kong Racing, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2, Goldeneye/Perfect Dark. A few to add for contention) And apparently I have some others to look into.... Great vid and edit! =)
Edit: Forgot, RE4 is the shit, and your right KOTOR was held back by its time and excited to see you say you would be interested in a KOTOR remaster. =)",
Hitman is a 10/10 for sure,
Feel like God Of War needs to be up there,
I saw the thumbnail earlier and didn't watch it this time I saw it was an atrioc video and was sold.,
now this is a youtube video if i’ve ever seen one !!!,
"I haven't finished the Video yet but I strongly believe the original 2007 gears of war is a perfect 10.  Halo 2/3, Cod 4 & MW2 also have to be right up there as well but Gears was a masterpiece for it's time.",
I can guarantee you if you took the  entire population of the earth and showed them the first 10 minutes and 15 seconds i can personally guarantee you not a single person would say he stabs himself in the thumb with the thumbtack he was playing with,
Wow no rdr2,
"Perfect 10s for me are terraria, omori and celeste. Terraria because its 15 dollars on steam and you can play it for like 200 hours without much boredom with the 4 classes, difficulties, custom seeds, and like 5.5k items, not to mention the mods which can easily give you over 1k on their own. Omori because it has probably the best story to any game I have ever played, honestly go play it if you haven't. And celeste because it has a great story, great gameplay, and lots of content.",
Wow?,
csgo is a 10/10 game. in the realm of FPS it is the long standing king and it only keeps growing year after year,
You should give Hyper Light Drifter a shot,
"Saying HL2 is not a 10/10 and SM64 is kind of not fair for HL2. SM64 is based on some fantasy world where an Italian plumber battles a giant turtle, you can use whatever the fuck sounds you want for anything. You can start out with a good sound and then say yeah we'll add it here just cause, and it would still relatively make sense. HL2 us a Sci fi adventure based on human experiences and the guns probably sound the way they do because it's supposed to be in the future and they probably made a lot of progress to converting more of the energy of the projectiles into motion rather than noise. It would make sense future guns do not sound as loud since they should not blow out the user's ear drum with each shot they took. Also even if you didn't add HL2 to the 10/10 list, HL1 at least deserved to be there for leading the way what video games could be. I dont mind the HL series being tech demos since they have been pretty good so far and they should push us into the future.",
"Borderlands 2, Terraria, and Chrono Trigger are all easy 10/10s",
"Sadge, no witcher 3",
3:40 what is the soundtrack in the background??,
Good ones,
"Have to give Red Dead Redemption 2 a 10/10. It isn't perfect, in my opinion no game I have played so far is, and once you play the hell out of it like I have, you see the seam where it gets repetitive, but I think on all aspects, it's superlative. Best thing is, I think there's still a LOT more to improve upon in the next installment if I ever see it in my lifetime.",
"GTA SA, is 10/10 back when it still supported online and was active, the story is great, the huge map(even to todays standards is quite large imo), the soundtrack, the main characters, the gang turf feature (wish this comes back for a GTA 6 if it makes sense). Mafia 2 and Mafia 1 Definitive edition are 10/10s for me, mafia 2 i've replayed about 10 times, it also has DLC content worth playing. Mafia 1 Definitive edition was and probably still is the best DE title to every come out, amazing story line, if you play this after Mafia 2 for the first time you'll notice how the 2 titles are closely connected.",
The Bioshock series is the GOAT for me. Perfect blend of thriller and action. Keeps you on your toes and has a great storyline.,
Persona 5 is definitely a 10/10,
"Tetris is 10/10 too
Edit(as I think of more): All of the trackmania games
Edit 2: 5d chess with multiverse time travel",
"Did this man seriously say ""CS:GO 1.6""? lmao",
Crypt of the serpent King easy,
factorio,
Talking shit about half life 2 sound design! Have you heard the combine death sound!?,
"For me I'd say Nier: Automata, BioShock, Titanfall 2, and Bloodborne are perfect 10/10 games. The music in Nier and Bloodborne is absolutely god-tier, and all have incredibly fun gameplay, engaging world's and stories, and phenomenal soundtracks and music.

Edit: Also how do you talk about Half-Life 2 and not mention Ravenholm! Like say what you want about the other levels but Ravenholm is a masterpiece of a level",
"Before seeing this video, here are my 10/10s. 

Hotline Miami, GTA5, Oblivion, Portal, Fallout NV, Donkey Kong country, mario kart wii, and arguably wii sports.",
this whole video makes me so hyped for Atrioc to play the Ori games. recently completed the first one and it was an amazing experience every step of the journey. such a pretty game every frame could be hung up as a piece of art.,
"How is Mario 64 possibly a 10/10? No shot somebody plays through it for the first time today and thinks it's perfect. The reason it holds up is because it's fun to watch speedrunning, cannonless isn't the new player experience lol",
The Stanley parable. 10/10,
Donkey kong country 2 is a perfect game.,
I’m so happy I started this conversation with one message in chat,
"I think Hades is a 8/10. I think it is too short, I think 1 extra level would have made it a 9.

I found it too easy for a Roguelike with me beating Hades around attempt 10, after that I pretty much won almost every run. The only thing that kept me playing was getting all the artifacts to 3* and all the Chibi Stickers..

As for multiplayer games, I'd give Modern warfare 2 and Black ops a 10/10... maybe it's because of the zombies as that is pretty much all I played. However they were the 2 games I actually played multiplayer for thousands of hours... Also the main campaign in those were probably the best of them all. (and World at war)",
Atrio is near perfect imo. Probably a 5/6,
"honorable mentions:
Far cry 3 (2012)
Ghost of Tsushima (2020)
Call of Duty Black ops 2 (2012)
Titanfall 2 (2016)
Batman Arkham Knight (2015)
Grand Theft Auto V (2013)
Red Dead Redemption 2 (2018)
Final Fantasy 7 (1997)
Call of Duty modern warfare 2 (2009)

Maybe some of these arent for everyone a 10/10 (like gta nowadays but just remember Doing heists with ur friends after school. Also it was like the game with the best graphics for 2013 by far)",
"YEAH FUCK SKYRIM! Played 30 hours of that game and felt like shit the whole way through! I know why it's such a beloved game, I saw some Videos that were fascinating, but I'm sorry, it feels like ass to play, I hate it so much!",
"Big A is a dunkey fan, no doubt.",
"remember we are listening to the guy who stabbed himself with a thumbtack.

 which I think makes his opinions more valid, I've done that like 5 times now.",
"Blood borne for me is a 10/10. The enemies, the environments, the combat, the music, the bosses, everything about it is just perfect and their really isn’t anything you could change to make it better.",
"Halo 3 is a 10/10, dunno why youd pick 2",
"I grew up with Wii games, and I think that Wii sport or Mario kart Wii are bangers, by their simplicity and how good they aged",
"I think that rating games from the N64 era with the ""for their time"" mindset but also not giving HL2 a 10 is crazy. But also I think CS creating the 5v5 bomb defusal mode which valorant yoinked and made worse by making it a hero shooter has to make it a 10 because the format has without a doubt stood the test of time.",
super mario galaxy is a 10 for sure,
"Having over 3000 hours in Hades, I appreciate it making this list.",
"Hey quick heads up, you forgot to put the the best game ever made, enjoyed by many gamers and viewers including myself, ""Paper Mario"" up there",
"I think the problem with majora's mask is that the time loop gimmic works fantastic for 95% of the game, untill it becomes tedius right at the end. It and oot are both great games, but I think mm would have been even better with 1 or 2 less sidequests happening at the same time.",
You gotta make a tier list bro,
The Walking Dead Telltale game just for the story. Only game to get me to cry.,
I think Mario Kart could be listed as a 10/10 multiplayer game,
"Titanfall 2 and Risk of Rain 2 comes to mind when i think of perfect games. Also Talos Principle, but that game defiently isnt 10/10, but i just love the narrative so much",
"yo props to the editor, alot of the context and information given was seamless to the video, clean",
the thumbtack is a perfect allegory for league,
The only 10/10s I’ve ever played are Minecraft and Cuphead,
No Kirby or GTA?,
"Factorio is a 10/10 in my book. It's really designed for a specific type of person, but if you are, you WILL sing hundreds or even thousands of hours into it if you don't set an alarm.",
That bo1 pistol reload sound tho,
New Vegas is 12/10,
"Modern warfare 2 is easily a 10/10. Everything was op, which made everything balanced.",
"As a truly casual game dude, Mario 64, Silent Hill 2, Minecraft (post MS purchase), Far Cry 3, MGS3 and BOTW are my 10/10s.",
Zelda OOT and MM are 10 out of 10 and I won't hear anything else,
"I'll have to go with
Metro series (last light is so immersive)
Darksiders
Jak & Daxter
Tony hawks THUG1/2 or Pro Skater",
Day 1 of commentinf on every atrioc video just to boost it in the alg,
Borderlands 2 is easily a 10/10.,
Sekiro litterly takes every game he talked about here and poops on it,
Thps 3 10/10 100%,
"Breath of the wild has to be a 10/10, it would be a 8/10 if not for the glitches",
"If atrioc never had a roommate who consistently played persona 5, and he played it himself I'm sure he'd put it up there. If not a 10/10 maybe a 9",
"modern warfare 2 got to be at least in the convo for 10/10 game for the time. Intense campaign, memorable characters, and was one of the best multiplayers for the time.",
Im not a big jrpg fan but ffx and persona 5 should get a mention here,
Play Tunic,
"OMORI was easily a 10/10 for me. I loved every single thing about that game, from the soundtrack, the gameplay, the pacing, the art, not to mention the story. It nailed everything perfectly.",
For me subnautica is a 10. Your first play through competes everything the game sets out to do.,
"I think kotor for me is a perfect game, even with it’s clunky movement and weird textures. i’ve played through that thing at least 15 times and each time i was having so much fun",
great [vod link] in the description,
Would agree with a lot of these. Halo 2 absolutely a 10. Id say Pokemon Red & Blue also and... Definitely would add Starcraft Broodwar and sc2.,
Oot and majora Mask ❤️,
Slippity dippity,
Super mario gaxaly one and two are personal 10/10 games but i feel like they aren't 10/10 perfect games that everyone will love,
Shadow of the Colossus is an absolute 10. Ignoring the camera and controls everything is as near to perfect as a video game can get.,
"Hell i'll put my 2 cents in, 
Borderlands, it was groundbreaking for its time, stylized so it looks great to this day, and its re-playability is almost at roguelike status because of the randomized loot which on release was a new thing.",
conkers bad fur day and mass effect 2 are 10/10,
YOU CANT JUST TEASE ATRIOC RACING LIKE THAT AND THEN END THE VIDEO WITH NO OTHER CONTEXT,
Mario 64 is a 9.9 only reason I spite it so much to not give it a perfect 10 is because of the damn camera. And shifting sand land,
you havent played the Reach campaign??? the best one???,
Halo 2 to this day is the best halo by far. It's the melee of the series. So much skill expression,
Yeah but have you heard the sounds from Toejam & Earl?,
He's calling out hl2 for feeling like a tech demo while super mario 64 has actual 1990s tech demos as levels 😂,
Big A does it again 👏,
fitting that overwatch was blocked by the 10/10 in the thumbnail,
"Titanfall 2 is the greatest shooter ever released

The campaign is unmatched in the genre, even the greats like modern warfare and black ops don’t have anywhere near the emotional impact of Titanfall 2s ending

And the multiplayer is FANTASTIC with and insanely high skill curling due to the movement possibilities but the game still feels approachable thanks to intuitive controls/physics, as well as AI enemies to make little billy still feel like he’s contributing. Not to mention the feeling anytime you are in a Titan, it’s like you can’t be stopped.

I love that game man",
I think league has to be a 10,
I don't like Hollow Knight at all. So Sorry. Also don't like Skyrim. Sorry not sorry.,
Whats the vod for this?,
Hollowknight without Grey Prince Zote is a 10/10,
shoutout to jimmyjomby,
"Imagine leaving Atrio out of this list. Don't let us down next time, Brandon!",
atrioc is the type of guy to swallow a thumbtack because he likes the pretty color,
"FIFA 14, the true GOAT",
Return of the Obra dinn is a true 10/10,
"I cannot in good conscience give Subnautica a 10/10, it is way too flawed. But it is my favorite experience I've had playing a video game.",
"I know most Zelda heads will shout OOT for their 10/10. It is a GREAT game yes, but in my opinion ""A Link to the Past"" on snes was and still is the most perfect Zelda game there has ever been. Also as a side note, sound goes CRAZY in that game. Remember hearing the master sword shoot the magic rings when you have full health for the first time? IMMACULATE! :)",
"Sound... seriously... Maybe I'm crazy, but I could literally mute any game that isnt story driven, and would have just as much fun listening to a podcast while playing. Sound is not that big of a deal.

Also, these games people claim are 10s in the comment section, mostly all of you are insane. Naming niche games, games with literally no new gameplay designs, nothing revolutionary. Ya'll batshit.",
Inscryption would be 10/10 for me. The immersion it creates when the player sits accross Leshy is just amazing,
great editing! good job,
Witcher 3 wild hunt is a 10/10 game,
"Outer Wilds will guaranteed warrant youtube content when you inevitably want to shout from the rooftops that its the best game of all time, you have to play it offline though",
"My nominations are Breath of the Wild, Assassin's Creed IV, and Street Fighter 2.",
"I'm personally of the opinion that there is no game ever made that's a 10/10. 10/10 insinuates that the game is perfect and there is no such thing as a perfect game. If you have any gripe with it, it's not perfect, even if those gripes are excusable for whatever reason",
waiting for paper mario,
"“Shadow of the colossus” and “Doom” (2016)
Two beautiful games in my opinion.
Not to long and they achieve exactly what they set out to do.",
No bloodborne?!😨,
I believe that God of War 2018 is 10/10,
Crazy how atrioc describes his perfect game and how much he loves hollow knight to still not play ori.,
"Whoever said Ac black flag in chat, you valid for that",
"From the many games I’ve played over the years, the ones I would qualify as 10/10s are Dark Souls 3, Portal 2, and Omori. Maybe minecraft",
Botw in my opinion is really good,
8,
"Dude, gun was a perfect 10",
its ironic that i agree with the list and also think new vegas is a better game than most of those but i would never give new vegas a perfect rating,
"first game that came to mind was Super Mario Wii, great levels, great music, good run time, has. hidden star coins for try hards for world 9, introduced true multiplayer to Mario bros, best launch game of all time. Carried the Wii.",
Minecraft is for sure a 10/10. I just spent a night singing minecraft karaoke in minecraft on a large pumpkin tower. perfect game.,
Hollow knight loses at least a whole point for how much back forth u have to go to find where you are going. super tedious,
ALL that fuck shit u said about half life 2 sounds ..... i cannot believe u:(,
Compared to other fps campaigns titanfall 2 blows them out of the water. I'd say it's a 10/10,
God of War for me is a perfect 10/10 the story about everything up to the Norse pantheon is just a master class in story telling even tho there was some flaws with the original trilogy the nostalgia alone gives it a 10/10,
Half Life 2 has the worst gun suonds? Has he ever played GTA San Andreas???,
atrioc is right I also hate the pistol sound in skyrim,
"Celeste is a truly flawless game, I genuinely can not think of a single change I would make that would make it better",
"Borderlands 2 is one of my 10/10 games. It's not perfect, but for everything it doesn't do perfect, it overachieves in every other aspect. Hell, Handsome Jack alone almost makes it a 10/10",
I’m ironically I love talking about games in this way. Wish I could’ve been there at this stream,
Gran Turismo 4 was for sure,
"- Banjo Kazooie (and probably Tooie as well)
- Smash Ultimate without a question
- Secret of Mana on SNES
- Eternal Darkness",
"I gotta say, as someone who played portal 2 for the first time last year, absolutely holds up, it’s such an incredible game even by today’s standards",
"Bioshock
Hollow knight
Furi
'nuff said.",
"as someone who played oot pretty recently, i cant agree with giving it a 10/10. a lot of it does hold up, its really impressive and mostly still fun, but some stuff just sucks. tons of bosses are frustrating, and tons of little things with movement and quality of life are lacking, and worst i think is that lots of mechanics/puzzles just dont make sense. i was playing alongside a friend whod already beaten it and there were many times i had to ask him what to do, and when i asked him how i was supposed to know what to do who couldnt tell me cause the game doesnt actually tell you. i honestly enjoyed playing zelda 1 (with a map cause that games a disaster otherwise) more, tho ill admit thats probably just me",
"Uncharted 4, God of War",
I think a true 10/10 and a game that blew my mind was Outer Wilds. Genuinely think it's a revolutionary game and so fun.,
Never been this early,
Please tell me Nier Automata is on this list.... please. I haven't watched it yet. That is probably the best game ever made.,
"God of War has to be a 10/10, just a perfectly crafted game. Cant wait for Ragnarok!",
This is biased asf lmao,
Mass Effect 2 needed to be on this list mr streamer,
Though I love portal 2 and it’s my absolute #1 game he do be right about it getting a more boring every time you play it.,
Mafia 2 is 10/10,
Outer wilds,
"To the chatter name mark with a k at 4:23, you are the most correct person there has ever been. Titanfall 2 was likely the most perfected game I’ve ever played",
"I think comparing single and multiplayer games on this ""what is a 10/10"" scale isn't really a good way of thinking about it. I think the original Donkey Kong Country is a 10/10 but it's not a 10/10 in the same way I think Street Fighter 4 is",
"You cannot give a game like Minecraft 10/10 for what it spawned or how big it is, you give games that score when they are high quality in every single area and frankly Minecraft is not high quality in anything except concept.",
Rayman Origins is 11/10,
Terraria 100% deserves it,
The Life is Strange franchise will forever be unbeatable for me. Those games are simply unmatched. They tick all my boxes. Even LIS 2 which doesn't have the sapphic lesbian characters that make the other games for me is fucking fantastic. The immersion is simply unmatched. You will play those games and they won't leave you mind for a weeks after that. Truely once in a lifetime experience.,
Witcher 3? Hello?,
I think it’s mandatory to have a mgs game on a 10/10 list,
Bioshock?,
Runescape sound effects,
"CS:GO has to be 10/10, very few big gameplay changes in over 2 decades, because the formula just works. Also probably the best esports game to watch (league is up there too)",
How are you gonna show Chrono Trigger when you bring up bad PS1 RPG's. That's just blasphemy. It's not even on PS1...,
"Even though Half Life 2 has aged significantly in terms of audio and visual design, it is legitimately one of the only few games from the early 2000's that's still playable all the way through for a normal person - quite easily. 

It is hands down a classic that is a 10 out of 10 in all aspects when looking at contemporaries from 2004",
"I would put Skyrim and HL2 in the 10/10 category, but I can respect not doing so. It’s hard to argue with a straight face that they have no glaring flaws.",
"You could've at least included one large story game that actually deserves 10/10, like God of War or RDR2",
I'd argue every full 3d mario game (especially galaxy) and undertale excluding the fanbase,
"Mario 64 is definitely great and Portal 2 was fun too but I only have eyes for Celeste and only very few games are coming close to that. Doesn't matter if it's sound, graphics (especially love to detail), physics, level design or story. It's the best game I've ever gotten to experience and I doubt there will be a game that is able to convince me otherwise. Besides the mentioned ones I think HK, Ori, Hades and SMG were very great too. I didn't enjoy HK and Ori as much because I don't like Metroidvanias but putting that aside there's no way I don't admit that they're great games. The last one I'd like to mention is Noita because you rarely see games that allow the player to do almost everything they wish for but of course that is the main gimmick besides the random generated world and I have to say that the game is pretty bad for beginners but if you manage to keep playing there is a lot of fun stuff you can do",
"I can’t believe he didn’t even mention the only true 10/10, paper Mario",
"terraria was a 10/10 when 1.1 came out. now it’s probably a 21/10 with all those huge updates they kept making for free. it’s a metroidvania set in a sandbox, fucking amazing",
"I agree with SM64 being a 10, but I really disagree on the gameplay holding up today. I'm an ex-speedrunner, I have a huge respect for the game and its movement, but playing it casually was pretty rough, especially in terms of controls and camera. Even just looking at the level design - though it is iconic and has some good concepts, it's clear that it is a very early 3D platformer. I played it as part of 3D all stars, and playing Sunshine right after makes it clear just how much the genre had matured since 64.",
"just played STRAY last night and it was amazing, debating a 10/10 for the worldbuilding",
"Skate 3 is 100% a 10/10. It will forever and always be a game to fall back on and have a good time playing it. There will always be more trick lines to do and more special spots to perfect. The graphics are still decent even though it came out for the Xbox 360. The soundtrack is good, good enough to not mute it and turn on your own playlist instead. All in all, Skate 3 is one of the best games all time and def a 10/10. Anyone who’s played skate 3 knows how great it is",
Red dead redemption 2 is a 10,
wait where's dos version of Will Harvey's zany golf (dos version),
GTA 4 a solid 10 of a game,

"What's with the HL2 slander?
Dissapointed.",
"Mario 64 doesnt hold up imo. As a Gen Zer, the controls feel jank as hell, especially after playing Odyssey. I think it was revolutioanry for the time, but its only really considered great by people who have been playing it since they were kids, or people who are willing to pour hrs into perfecting the tricks, which to me, means it cant be 10/10",
i originally played ocarina of time when i was 10 and i sorta forgot about it coz i preferred the other 3d zelda games with majoras mask being my favourite game of all time but then i replayed oot when i was 17 and i realised how well crafted the dungeons were compared to other zelda games and i find it to have the best pacing of all the zelda games,
left4dead had an psychiatrist and therapist on the the credits for making everything satisfying,
"One of my few 10/10 games has to be terraria. It has so much replayablility and the expeierence Is enjoyable all the way though. The soundtrack, the bosses, the weapons, and the environment all come together to make a perfect game in my opinion. Definitely would recommend giving it a try",
"Link to the Past definitely deserves a 10/10 too. It was way ahead of its time on the SNES with its dual worlds, and every dungeon felt perfect. You had a sense of open world but also had a clear objective at every stage of the game. Even now I believe it still holds up beautifully.",
You should play The Messenger,
Great list! Never played melee or beat sm64 but I know they are both great games. I still think a multiplayer game could've  been added tho. Like bo2 or halo 2.,
Commenting for the algorithm,
"I disagree on half life 2, yeah the pistol sound isnt the best but 99% of the sound design in that game is spot on, also out side of the game it was pretty revolutionary for its modding scene and things like garys mod and all the games that came from it, like prop hunt games, wouldnt exist without it",
"I feel like melee is socially a 10/10 but in gameplay it's definitely not
(Still high tho)",
10:30 wtf is that emote lmao,

"Garden Warfare 2 is my 3rd favourite game but I think out of my top 3 it's the one I'd concider a 10/10. Maybe bowser's inside story but definitely not xenoblade 2 (which is my absolute unchallenged favourite but also very much flawed). Otherwise, I think I've played a couple games that near perfection. Undertale has to be a 10/10 for sure, so does mystery dungeon 2. I don't think it's perfect but I genuinely believe Astral chain is very close, that game is criminally underrated! And of course botw (and imo hw:aoc also comes very close but I'm propably the only one saying that, I absolutely fucking loved every second of 100%ing that game), and mario 64. Other games I've played that are very good are: Isaac, Dead Cells, Fighterz, Smash ultimate, pokemon Black/white, legends arceus, Hades, minecraft for suure, maybe Fortnite??",
Terraria is a 10/10,
half life sounds were iconic thats an L take big a,
Mass effect 2 ? Or whichever part you guys prefer but for me definitely 2.,
tf2 is a 10/10 ez,
"For me a 10/10 is probably Metal Gear Solid 3. The Gameplay is still one of the best Stealth Experiences ever made, the characters are amazing, it looks amazing for the time, its infinitely creative. Just absolutely amazing.",
I absolutely cannot excuse how someone in chat called Resident Evil 4 a 7/10. I need to meet this person I cannot understand what is going on in their head,
portal 2 is a masterpiece,
Phantom Dust,
bruh,
"Minecraft, Terraria, Earthbound, Stardew Valley, Yakuza 0, Portal 2, OMORI, Phoenix Wright Ace Attorney Trilogy are some of mine",
enjoyed the editing,
I hate ranking anything as a 10/10 because nothing is without a flaw even if it is a relatively small flaw.,
pokemon 10/10,
Ahaha give the thumbtack a 10 had me dying,
"Fallout: New Vegas is my GOAT, it was the first time playing a game that I felt like my decisions actually mattered. The STORY, setting, and even most of the dlc is impecable and holds up to this day.",
Pen Pen TriIcelon for Dreamcast was 10/10.  It's superior to Fall Guys in every way.  Truly flawless.,
Hear me out. Minesweeper,
Chrono Trigger / Final Fantasy VI hold up incredibly well imo.,
That thumbtack worked out exactly like League of Legends.,
"God of war 3 is so fucking good that it killed the genre no one makes games like that anymore, not even the new devil my cry is has cooler combat than gow3 that game just rocks, and it still rocks",
"Ill still play GGST just to hear that sweet ass ""COUNTER""",
"Reach is the best Halo campaign hands down. The change in pace of the story was unbelievable. It was emotional not because of the main character like other halo games, but because of the characters you grow to care for. A group of lesser known Spartans giving all they got to finish the mission. 10/10 hands down. And it’s new enough to hold up for a long long time.",
"I’m playing through Portal 2 for the first time right now, and I have to say I love it. The voice acting is amazing, the writing is great, the humor is genuinely hilarious, the immersion is crazy good, and the puzzles are genuinely challenging. Quickly becoming one of my favorite games tbh.",
I knew you were a fake gamer Big A....Big Rigs: Over the Road Racing is clearly a 10/10,
10/10 game is for sure Plants vs Zombies Garden Warfare.,
Unsighted and SSBU are my forever goats <3,
"Mario 64 is not a 10/10 game. The DS version is just a better version. Which makes the original, worse.",
"no call of duty?? the best selling game of all time ? lol. L list, we get you nerds are pc gamers and play cringe games, but show some respect on the biggest selling game of all time",
M&M Beach party is 999/10,
Deaf people,
"I really wanted to write how I don't agree with everything. But then I thought to myself: ""Why? You stinky ass?""
Of course people have different opinions on games and not everyone will agree that a game is a 10/10.
So now I respect your list and write hate comments on my alt accounts to make everyone angry and sad while I feel like a generous god on this account.

Edit:
Ghost Master is 10/10 and you guys don't even know what it is! Give that game a sequel you cowards!",
Does anyone know what stream this is from?,
"In terms of the RPG genre my go to is always Xenoblade Chronicles. It pushed that lil ol Wii to its limit for some of the most beautiful areas in gaming, a life changing story and characters that bring both heavy hitting moments and the funniest lines ever read.",
For me a 2014 roblox game called twisted murder is still to this day the only game I could genuinely play for years,
monster hunter 4 ultimate is a 10 out of 10. fight me,
any game that still recieves updates shouldnt be considered a 10/10 since they have the opportunity to fall off at any moment eg. roblox and minecraft,
I played Skyrim for the first time last year on my Xbox 360 so it wasn’t as polished as the newer versions at all and it’s still in my probably top 3 games all time,
shadow of the colossus...,
Bro tf you mean i played half life 2 for the first time in 2020 and i love it. Portal 2 is a better overall game though.,
Hollow knight <3,
"Skyrim is definitely not 10/10, but it stands in a league of its own when it comes to community content and mods. So much so that Enderal is my 10/10 game, even though it is technically a ""Skyrim mod."" It elevates everything from the story, to the progression, to even mechanics like stealth and magic. I recommend it to everyone, especially those who felt Skyrim was just lacking.",
None. I rest my case,
Chip's Challenge,
terraria ?????????????,
I don't think a game can get any more perfect than cuphead,
"For me darl souls 3 is a 10/10
Everything about it is perfect to me, it masters the linear souls like experience",
"""Halflife 2 is not a 10/10 game"" ffffffff uuuuuuuuuu - dislike and unsubscribe. For the record - ive replayed halflife 2 countless times and used to speed run it",
"Majora's mask is a kinda 11 or a 10 DLC for OOT, OOT is clearly a 10, and to appreciate the weirdness of Majora's you have to know OOT",
"Heard it here first, ""thumbtacks are fun!""",
"The swamp boat section in HL2 was so drawn out, I forgot there was *other gameplay*

Also, if there was a game that had Sunshine's movement with SM64's level design, it would easily be a perfect game",
"The problem with Sekiro is that it looks like the purpose of the game is to not play it.. and it ends as a boss rush
Like you come to a place, there's a whole bunch of ennemies, god forbid you dare to breath near of them and all of them start to chase you, you have a whole arsenal of fighting and escaping but to survive you can only escape, so you understand and you escape everytime until the boss.. great",
Atrioc saying hl2 isn’t a 10/10 because of the gun sounds being bad is so unfair,
"Bro, Fable 2???",
"I hardly ever hear about Enter the Gungeon out of roguelikes, but I trully feel like people sleep on it, I just can't realy think about any flaw that the game has, it is a beautfull, well balanced game, with great music, massive replayability, a verry nice lore and tons of references and inteligente humor. I understand that it is not a game for everyone, but for the it's genre I believe it to be one of the verry best.",
"biggest missed games:

terraria
red dead redemption 2 - need i say more
titanfall 2 - best movement shooter ever made, story was incredible
risk of rain 2 - probably most fun-oriented rogue-like
rocket league - besides its community being terrible it's probably the most polished multiplayer games ever made and the physics are very satisfying

anything i missed?",
Cuphead 10/10 for me.,
Team Fortress 2 would also be 10/10 if ValVe fixed game and bots didn't exist,
2:55 can confirm played it for the first time a few weeks ago 10/10 one complaint is that it would be better with giant red YouTube arrows,
"I'd say chess is a 10/10.
It was created in medieval times and engines now show how balanced it is.
You can play fast, slow, blindfold and online, which makes it a video game ;)",
"Katana Zero is absolutely a 10/10 for me. Sound, music, mechanics, animation, level design, characters, and not to mention the rich and beautifully crafted story makes this game one that should test the time and stand up there with the greats.",
I’d probably throw Diablo 2 into that. I spent countless hours in that game.,
"Tragedy to not have an OG Psychonauts mention, even though its a bit of a cult classic and has some flaws. The level design, art style, and the way they distill very adult issues regarding mental health into all aspects of the game absolutely blew me away when I played it last year.",
"Metal Gear Solid 1, 2, 3 are definitely all contenders for 10/10

I think MGS2 stands the test of time more than 1 and 3 because how relevant the messages it had are today",
Atrioc describing Celeste without realising it lol 0:01,
mirrors edge better be on here,
im convinced that atriocs hl2 opinion is for views,
dead space,
super mario odyssey has a special place in my heart… i’m someone who unfortunately finds it pretty tedious to play single player games but 100% it because of how much fun i had. the movement and level design is so clean and polished i couldn’t stop playing.,
Ghost of Tsushima,
"Personal 10/10 Games:
Papier Mario TTYD and Xenoblade Chronicles X.
Paper Mario TTYD: yea from an outside perspective it probably isn’t a 10/10 but for me it’s the perfect game, great music, amazing story, fun gameplay and very fun and well written characters.
And it’s the perfect sequel, it took a lot of systems from Papier Mario 1 and just improved them

Now for the more underrated Gem here: Xenoblade Chronicles X.
Admittedly it’s not a 10/10 game (for me it is) but again outside perspective it’s probably More an 8/10.
BUT the world is amazingly designed and vast, the combat is very fun with a lot of variety AND skill expression (if you choose to sink your time into it) it’s a great Hardcore player game, aka it’s very rewarding for people that sink a lot of time into it WHILE STILL being a great casual game too.
I could go on and on about This games world building etc. (HAVE YOU HEARD THE SOUNDTRACK? Uncontrollable is forever stuck in my head) and while yes it’s More a spiritual successor to the First it was still absolutely amazing. (Give it a try if you have a WiiU)",
I think ori and the will of the wisps is also a 10/10. One of the best I’ve ever played and a very emotional ending,
Superhot is easily 10/10,
"I'm a HL2 stan, but I'll agree that it's not a 10/10. There's a lot of unnecessary padding with the vehicle sections. But there's no doubt that HL2 was incredibly influential and innovative.
Hollow Knight is 10/10. And it was made by 3 people. Incredible.",
celeste is a 10/10 game 🙂,
"I agree, skyrims gun sounds are trash",
YOU FORGOT MORBIUS1!!!1!1,
Titanfall 2 is a 10/10,
if he says rdr2 is 10/10 im going to lose it,
NieR Automata still holds as a 10/10 for me with the way the story is told and the amazing soundtrack,
my only 10 out of 10 games are fruit box and jstris,
"Imo terraria is a 10/10. I think it achieves everything Minecraft sets out to do and more. I think the only thing Minecraft does better is the level of creativity you can have with building. But in terms of gameplay, atmosphere and replayabilty, I think terraria is exceptional.",
Dark souls 1 goated. That's all I have to say,
"Big A is spitting some truths on Half Life 2. Fantastic/revolutionary opening, but wtf is the rest of the game. It *really* falls off",
"minecraft is like not even 8/10 imo 
the coding is ass on java. the fact that you have to download a mod made by people to get consistent frames for a game made by one of the biggest companys in the world is insane 
also there is a big lack of content in the game comparing it to a game like terraria i dont think tis even close 
if you want a chill game id say something like stardew valley is miles better if you want something for exploration theres endless better choices including terraria which is more of a combat game bc the minecraft over world is all uninteresting and samey",
imagine talking about video game sounds and half life 2 and NOT SHOWCASING THE AR2,
i never comment but the editing was great. not sure if zinjo is new or not but great job. you turned atriocs rambling into a great video.,
atrioc we’re begging you just play celeste for a few hours please,
"for me, Stardew Valley",
Mother 3 without a doubt is a 10/10 it's one of the most beautiful games I've ever played,
Dishonored 2 is a 10/10 in my book,
"I'd say Journey and Mario Galaxy are easy 10/10's. 
Deep Rock Galactic is debatable, but I'd say it comes very close to being 10/10
If Ultrakill keeps up the quality it currently has all the way to its full release it's also an easy 10/10 for me.",
titanfall 2 and the original sw battlefront gotta be added,
Outer Wilds is the only game i consider absolutely perfect.  no flaws at all.  you should REALLY play it but put chat emote only to really discover it,
"Disco Elysium and Outer Wilds are both easy 10/10 games in my opinion. They both take incredible advantage of the interactivity of video games to tell stories and deliver experiences that wouldn't be possible in any other medium. They're excellent games but also great works of art, and accomplishing both at the same time puts them each in contention for a top 5 spot in the list of all-time greats.",
Mario cart holds a special place in my heart,
"I actually think that either the new Spider-Man or Spider-Man: Miles Morales could be a 10. They're definitely 9s. The webswinging is as revolutionary today was it was in Spider-Man 2, so like Minecraft and Mario 64, I think it holds up",
He’s a 10 but he teaches economics on mondays. He’s an 11,
mount&blade warband is a 10/10 and i'm definitely not saying that to justify the fact that i have 8000 hours in the game,
"When the topic about multiplayer games came up, I instantly thought of Deep Rock Galactic. It's an amazing co-op game, I convinced my friends to play it saying it's like a mix between Minecraft and Left 4 Dead. Tons of replayability, customization gameplay and cosmetic wise. We bought it almost a month ago and we all already have over 100 hours

I would actually love to see Atrioc, Ludwig and Stanz play it ngl haha",
Breath of the wild?,
undertale is 10/10 even if the fandom is a little bit cringe,
"For me, the one game that hits 10/10 is Doom Eternal, Best singleplayer fps of all time",
Tf2,
"as someone who played every halo on release up to halo 4, i think Reach had one of the best campaigns. Maybe not the absolute best, but i really loved the things that made Reach different than the previous Halo games",
Resident evil 4. No doubt,
It’s funny you say this about the sounds of half life because I have like 1k hrs on rust and I solely stopped playing because they’re recently changed the gun audio and it’s just annoying and gross,
I didn't realize Big A hadn't beaten Elden Ring yet,
Oot is a 10,
"Sounds like nonsense to me. Minecraft was cool for a while,but after windows bought it... I can't even try to play it again. 

If I build my fishing house, then the fucking night bats come over and fuck my ass.
10/10 because it has modding?
It was so much nicer when there wasn't those super fancy gap closing monsters.

If you ask from me I'm not sure if I ever have seen 10/10 game.

I began with PS1 and started with Crash Bandicoot when I was 3 years old. My mom played it for me first,but I got the controller at some point,and I remember that I played the game for first in the level called ""Jaws Of Darkness"".
NaughtyDog delivered the games I had there were some games that weren't from them, but best times I had with games where I could share it with others. I have a little sister, and uncle, with one of them I played Crash Bash, and with the other I played the Sims 2 which was PS2 version. I think it's better than PC which doesn't let it play through as comfy settings as PS version does.

I think Portal 2 is 8/10. It has cool cuts, but as it lets the setting visually take a step out, I feel like you really are just taking a step into WIP game. I think that drops it a bit. It needs a beat there, but not like that.",
Where the hell is Fortnite,
"The editing on this video is so good. Not over the top, but enough added jokes to be hilarious.",
Uncharted? The Batman Arkham games?,
"For me there has been no game even remotely mechanically competitive while also maintaining the ability to utilize tactics and mind games like in Rocket League. Rocket League is a sport played on a screen, every single thing that happens is in your hands, you just have so much influence with everything you do.
Rocket League is the perfect esport game imo, that’s why it deserves a 10/10",
"'I'm not a big Minecrafter'

I'm guessing Big A is forgetting that absolutely fucking stellar house he built, Dream could never.",
"I love minecraft, but it's hilarious to me that you called it polished. As a speedrunner, you wouldn't believe the kind of bugs I've encountered in modern versions, let alone back when it released. Still gets an easy 10/10 for me though",
fortnite🗿.,
"shoutouts to the chat member who said outer wilds because i agree wholeheartedly, if you haven't played that game yet you absolutely should without looking up anything about it beyond the store page and trailers.",
The only reason he didn't list Outer Wilds is because it's an 11/10,
"If we're talking about perfect games, we need to speak about Stardew Valley. There's no one right way to play with the multitude of things you can do in it, and there's something for everyone to enjoy. The sound, music and gameplay are all so incredibly charming that you can't help but get pulled into it's relaxing and whimsical world. Even more impressive is the fact that the entire thing was made by a single dev who clearly loves his game and the community of players around it. 

Stardew Valley is an indisputable GOAT.",
celeste should 100% be on this list. legitimately the only game where I can't name a single actual flaw. Game is so god damn perfect.,
I think your avoiding the elephant in the room. The absolutely timeless classic of paper Mario. 10/10,
Castlevania Symphony of the Night. Perfect 10/10.,
"Can’t tell if the games showed compared to OOT is trolling or not. Chronotrigger came out on snes over three years before OOT, and FF7 was almost a year before OOT",
"Portal 2 transformed how I perceived games. I mean i was always a degenerate gamer, and i had games in my childhood that i definitely loved, but nothing captivated me like Portal 2 did. Perfect fucking game. You know how some people say they wish they could forget a game or show or movie so they could experience it for the first time again? I don't say that for much, because a lot of the time it's being able to connect with people over your shared experience that really creates good memories, but Portal 2 is the one exception. I would give anything to experience Portal 2 for the first time again.",
Breath of the wild 10/10,
"Any love for NieR Automata? Game genuinely made me cry, the soundtrack is phenomenal, the gameplay is amazing, the story beats are so well paced and put together. I really can't sing enough praise for this game.",
"I rented Super nintendo games from Blockbuster and one day my Mom and I walked in and the guy just about finished setting up Super Mario 64 and he plugged in a cord and turned the power on and he gave me the controller. I was one of the first to ever get their hands on it, it's an experience like no other as a kid.",
I'm surprised no one even mentioned Tony Hawk's Pro Skater,
Elden ring is an awesome game but i can't play it cause ubisoft ruined open world games with the grind and exploring now just feels tedious and annoying. so i'd rather just play an on rails game than play an open world,
Super Mario sunshine. And the dishonoured series. One and two. For me anyways.,
"LoL can never be a 10/10 because Dota 2 isn't a 10/10 and LoL is a worse version of that, so whatever you give Dota 2, subtract 3 and you get LoLs score.",
"Saw chat mentioning Control as a 10/10. While I do love Control, I would put it at 9/10 personally because I always felt the map layout and design was very frustrating at times. I still loved it, and would love to see it on the channel",
Stardew Valley? 🥲,
"Mario 64 cannot be 10/10 just because of the dog water controls. Even if everything else is absolutely perfect, if the game controls like a chicken with its head cut off, it can't be 10/10",
"The HL2 pistol sounds wimpy and weak because it is a wimpy and weak weapon. It communicates the weapon attributes through the audio design. It's also wierd how he ranked HL2 today's standards but M64 was ranked by its days standards. Regardless, I'd argue that HL2 is still one of the best shooters today, and that's for the entire game, not just the intro",
"As a old FPS player, battlefield Bad Company 2 should be considered a perfect game.",
"Paper Mario: The Origami King is a 10, you should play it again",
I think Rocket League deserves mention when discussing 10/10 multiplayer games,
imagine thinking half-life 2 isn't timelss,
destiny 1 taken king is a 10/10,
without a doubt Minecraft is a 10/10,
Hot take: Skyrim wasnt even the best game of its kind when it came out.,
"For me. Again, me. I think half life 2 is a masterpiece but may not be a 10 out of 10 after what Atrioc said. However, it has been almost 20 years since half life 2 came out, and Ateioc is complaining about THE SOUND OF THE GUNS. If that is it, it is a masterpiece as people have completely different opinions on sound as moat people do not take notice of it.
Another thing to add is that the gun sounds of half life 2 vs 1, 2 is better because a lot of the game is shooting, so if you have an anoying pistol sound from half life 1 in your ears all of the time, you would get sick of it.
Also sice half life 2 got released 6 years after its original, the sound will have been improved and not downgraded. As there is no point of making a game which is worse than it's original, and all of the fans seemed to pick up on that after you see half life 2's popularity when it came out.",
"I always liken Mario 64 to a vintage gun, like a winchester model 70, for the time it was an amazing gun and even now it's serviceable since it's not rocket science on how to use it. But since then so many innovations have come about that if you've never used a model 70 it would feel very clunky. I was born past the time of the N64 and I don't understand why people still think Mario 64 is a timeless game. I know and appreciate what it did for gaming as a whole, but I think something like Banjoo & Kazooie is a much better game.",
God of War (2018) is the only 10/10 i have seen or played.,
I really hope that he decides to play ori with how much he loved hollow knight. Also Celeste is a 10/10 play it gh,
"God of War 2018, easy 10. Come on y’all.",
"What I love about Elden Ring and what makes the size work for me is that the enemies and fights matter.  
You kill a big ol knight, he's gone. He's not respawning in the next outpost for you to liberate over and over. 
You beat the game one fight at a time which gives you a proper sense of progress.",
Half life 2 is a fucking masterpiece,
Metal gear rising is un ironically a 10 out of 10 no game has has a resurgence like it for a reason. It delivers fast pace action that no game has even come close to producing now. Nothing comes close.,
the editing in this video was a 10/10,
Halo reach campaign is so good,
"Terraria has ruined my view on Minecraft honestly. I love minecraft but it drops off so quickly. By the time you have all the good stuff there’s nothing to do with it, nothing to challenge you. I have yet to check out 1.9 so maybe the deep dark and warden have helped the issue but as it stands, terraria just does the crafting/building/fighting style game better imo!",
Fifa 13 is the most 10/10 game you will ever see,
The witcher 3 is still my favorite game,
"May not be a 10/10 but Titanfall 2 (and even Titanfall 1) should be in the conversation. Respawn really outdid themselves and went beyond everything they could’ve set out to do. It’s a real shame to see the state the servers are in now, and even sadder is the plan that EA had to try and murder the franchise before Apex legends was able to start printing money",
"Hollow knight, bloodborne and Terraria are 10/10s for me",
Where Deus Ex?,
"Mr glizzster, I would like a formal apology for your outrageous claims of Half-life 2, how can you propose Half-Life 2 as not a ""Masterpiece"" a ""10 out of 10"" and if Half-life 2 is not a ""10 out of 10"" what is your review on Half-life Alyx?",
Portal 2 is fun as fuck when you memorized all the puzzles because you feel so de-stressed,
kotor 2 10/10 best game with tslrcm,
I hope Atrioc plays both of the Ori games and updates this list.,
"For me, 10/10 doesn't necessarily have to mean ""Greatest game of all time"" material. Games, and how good they are, are ultimately subjective to the individual. No one game will please EVERYONE, but if a game is 10/10, then to me that means it achieves everything it set out to do for the audience it targets, and the genre it's in (either setting a new standard in quality or inventing mechanics that become a genre staple).

That being said, I agree with most of Atrioc's choices (not 100% sure I'd agree with Melee, but it's close). If you don't want to read a book, stop here lol. I would add a few more from my personal experience:

Terraria: I heard this quote somewhere that resonated with me ""The worst thing about Terraria is that it ends"". It has such a good hook with its progression system, and the amount of replayability and sheer polish it has, plus being a clear labor of love (pun intended) from it's developers makes it perhaps the easiest 10/10 I can think of.

Slay the Spire: Correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm pretty sure this game invented a new genre in the form of ""deckbuilding roguelike"" that games like Incryption, Dicey Dungeons, and Peglin have built from. It does everything it tries to do with flying colors, and anytime I play a round or two after a break, I find myself sucked in for the next few weeks.

Smash Ultimate: This might be obvious to some. It's a miracle this exists to the level of magnitude and polish it reached, and it will almost certainly never happen again. I know I said Melee might not be a 10, and my reason is that it is horribly (but understandably) unpolished, and that's part of the reason it holds up oddly enough. But Ultimate manages to triple the roster size, while still having decent balance between all characters, AND it remains very polished overall. Without a doubt this lives up to its subtitle of Ultimate, and join Melee as a game that will still be revisited even after 5 new entries have come out.

DOOM (2016) and DOOM Eternal: Yes, i'd consider BOTH of them 10/10. DOOM 2016 already set the bar for singleplayer shooters at the time of its release, and somehow DOOM Eternal makes it feel slow in comparison. Either way, both games are unrivaled by any other franchise to deliver a more adrenaline pumping FPS experience thanks to the hyper-fast paced gameplay and unrelentingly headbanging soundtrack. Also worth mentioning how detailed and unique the level designs are. Twin Masterclasses in the FPS genre.

Honorable mentions (9.5-9.9/10):

Kid Icarus: Uprising: Explained this in a reply to a different comment. Only flaw is the controls, port it to a new system with a more manageable control scheme in the ground segments and it's an easy 10.

Xenoblade Chronicles: Only the first game. Felt wrong to call it a 10 because I haven't played enough JRPG's to compare this to, but by itself it is immaculate in worldbuilding and storytelling. The fact this originally came out on the Wii astounds me. 2 had its issues, hope 3 doesn't dissapoint.

Basically every mainline Mario game not called Super Mario Brothers 2: The Lost Levels, or Mario Land 1.

There's more, I'm sure, but I gotta sleep at some point tonight lol. That's what came to mind off the top of my head, anything else I'm either forgetting right now or I haven't played. If you read all that, I'm flattered you cared that much about my opinions, and if you had any others I missed, let me know and why. It's interesting to hear what others think, and if you're reading this far, you probably agree XD.",
"I know it's a meme at this point, but my 10/10 is Witcher 3. It does everything I want in a game phenomenally: story, atmosphere, world, characters, soundtrack. I'm sure there's more I'm forgetting. I know that the gameplay is simple and boring for a lot of people, but that's part of the reason I like it. It's not an Elden Ring where I'm going to be bashing my head against the desk for an hour trying to get past a monster. Just enough difficulty to make it fun. Not the type of game for someone with a grinder mindset like Atrioc though.",
No goat simulator?,
Atrioc would probably fucking love Outer Wilds it's a crime he hasn't played it yet,
I know the video is about games that are 10/10s but you know what game doesn’t deserve the 10/10s that it always gets? Mario odyssey that game makes Kirby look like dark souls and any play through other than your first one makes me fall asleep,
What ever your a,
"I love melee, but sorry that's just objectively not a 10/10 competitive game. Only 1/3rd of the cast is playable on a remotely competitive level, and it also overcomplicates things beyond a point of reason and fun. Your judgement is just really jaded because of how many friends you created in the community. 

L canceling is a perfect example of what i'm talking about. If your moves just automatically L cancelled, the game would just be strictly better. It doesn't take any real skill, it's just muscle memory that gates bad players who don't know it's a thing. It's also essentially invisible, so it's just a massive advantage you're getting over someone new, and they'll never know it's a thing unless you tell them. There's also the coding issues, like Game and Watch aerials being counted as specials, making them unable to be L cancelled. Or even things like infinite stalls via Jigglypuff or infinite pummels via Ice Climbers. Not to mention chain grabs (like 10+ is a problem), invisible ceiling glitch, port priority existing, and like 90% of the stages being unusable. Also, bigger than all of those, the fact that every character has a different amount of lag after jumping before you can aerial. This is something that feels absolutely horrible to new players, but because you're not new you don't even remember that it exists because the timing is just ingrained in your head. Ultimate fixed that by letting you queue up attacks to automatically go off after the lag, which feels significantly better to someone new, and Project M fixed it by setting that lag amount to be the same for every character so learning someone new doesn't mean struggling to do even the most basic movements.

So yeah... sure maybe the melee you know with a ton of custom rules added on by players and the 7-ish playable characters is really fun and really good competition, but it's undeniably flawed in multiple aspects - which just literally can't be a 10/10. A 10/10 doesn't have to be LITERALLY perfect, because no game is literally perfect, but melee isn't even close to perfect. I'd still give it a 9/10, but yeah literally no reasoning in the entire world could get it up another point when you consider everything. Your experience playing vs other good players I don't doubt is a 10/10, but your experience isn't THE experience.",
"Through many years of experience, the game in my opinion that is a Perfect 10 is paper mario. Such thoughtful gameplay that is really is like no other. Big A you should play this masterpiece of a game.",
Play Outer Wilds Atrioc!!!,
Nobody saying Ori so I thought I'd at least put it up for consideration,
"Breath of the Wild, Skyrim, and Pokemon Emerald are my 10/10s.",
SKYRIM,
Arkham Asylum/city,
melee is not a 10/10 i get the comp scene is good but the game is so broken and buggy and VERY unbalanced,
What about Blooms?,
Mario Galaxy is the GREATEST GAME OF ALL TIME!!!!!,
Thumbtacks were ahead of its time 10/10,
"MGS3, MGS4, The Last of Us, RDR2, TLOU 2, God of War, Elden Ring, Uncharted 2, Assassin’s Creed 2 are the only games I’d give a guaranteed 10/10 to and will fight to defend that.",
"Pokemon red/blue, Final Fantasy 14 Endwalker, terrarria, castlevania symphony of the night and pokemon mystery dungeon explorers of sky are also 10s.",
"Deep rock galactic is up there, there’s nearly nothing to dislike in it",
Om pretty sure TLOU2 got near perfect 10s even tho Ghost of Tsushima was better,
Tetris 10/10,
"Kid icarus uprising was one of my favorite, but yeah the controls have'nt aged that well",
"Honestly 100% agree with all the ones he listed except maybe Hades but definitely Resident Evil 4. Hades is good, but it isn't a timeless masterpiece that we will remember 10 years from now. Resident Evil 4 is one of those flawed masterpieces. For the time it was absolutely groundbreaking and single handedly defined the genre of 3rd person action shooters that would follow in it's footsteps for over a decade to come, while putting a new action spin on survival horror, while also being visually stunning, all around incredibly fun to play, and the list goes on. 

However, having gone back and played Resident Evil 4 recently even with the PC re-master with a high fidelity graphics mod and an updated control scheme... The last half of the game becomes such a slog. You just start feeling like clearing room after room after room of the same generic bad guys like you've been doing for over 10 hours is getting to be a big chore, the witty one liners get weaker, and the whacky Scooby-Doo bullshit reaches extreme levels of campiness that shouldn't be possible. Enemies don't even become harder either, they just become bigger and bigger bullet sponges with new skins. That game could have heavily benefitted from more enemy variety and better weapon progression to make it feel less repetitive.

I feel like Resident Evil 5 really did what Resident Evil 4 did, but slightly better in every single way and I'd still give that a 9/10. RE4 is an 8/10 but still a genre-defining groundbreaking game for the time. I'm excited to see what they do with the remake and whether or not they will make it totally faithful to the original or iron out some of the kinks. Do you think we'll still be able to look up Ashley's skirt? These things are very important.",
PORTAL 2 IS FKING AMAZING YESS,
My gilzzzy Daddy,
"BL2 is a 10/10 for me. I've never played a game that is somehow more fun on each playthrough. The story is solid, but the gameplay is masterful and the weapons are also really fun to goof around with. It doesn't take itself too seriously with most of the jokes landing.",
not mentioning metal gear solid 1 or final fantasy 7 😐,
Terraria 10/10,
"Street Fighter 2, as someone who worked on the original Street Fighter back in the day, seeing what they did with the Street Fighter 2 blew my mind, seeing how that has led us to one of my favorite genres, I have to give it a 10/10.",
Just play kotor it will not disappoint,
"OoT biatch, sometimes the popular opinion is the correct one",
"Love me some Big A but including melee feels a bit weird to me (I've been in the scene since 2014, i love this game) because hes not talking about melee as a whole. He's talking about a very hyper specific subsection of the game designed for competitive play. He's not talking about single player campaign, break the targets, 100 man wire-frame survival as Donkey Kong. I think if Atrioc only played 2 minute coin battle as bowser dittos he wouldn't consider melee a 10/10. competitive melee is a timeless classic but melee as a whole game.... well it shows that it was rushed.",
"Resident Evil 4 truly is such a wild 10 out of 10. Solid gameplay. Great attention to detail. Fun. Challenging at times. But when you put time into it, it's so satisfying when you really understand its tricks and such. It's a game that keeps getting re-released and I don't mind replaying. RE4R has a serious beast to contend with.",
Banjo Kazooie?,
Ngl im sad you missed so many GOAT games,
"If you look at 2004 games (San Andreas, Far Cry, Battlefront 1, Doom 3, Red Dead Revolver to name a few action ones) you see why Half Life 2 is a 10/10. As you said it revolutionized gaming in general but no other game of that time was as immersive and it made everything Half Life 1 did better. Gunplay feels better, environmental storytelling is better, enemies are better, map design is better, not to mention that of course at the time Source looked insanely good.

Also nova prospekt is good whaddahell",
"imo Halo 3 is the peak of every FPS campaign ever + one of the best game soundtracks of all time, in a game that still looks beautiful to this day (other than the faces).",
"Outer Wilds is the closest game to a 10/10 for me, although hollow knight is a close second. The ambient sound, music, easter eggs, control mechanics, story and world, and the immersion i felt all added up to one of the best gaming experiences I've felt. I was so addicted to that game",
"Mario 64s movement feels weird, especially the camera",
Guitar hero 3,
"I think Metal Gear Rising is a timeless game. Overwhelmingly generic on the surface but has nuance when you really examine it, its nuanced. If not a 10/10 now, give it a few years i'd say",
I don’t think Atrioc has played Skyrim,
"atrioc if youre looking for a game that truly feels like a single player mmo you should play Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning 
its the most single player mmo feel i ever had and even if im wrong its just a fun action rpg",
Bioshock is a 10/10. The atmosphere and story telling is unmatched.,
1:20 all the gun sounds have been made iconic via gmod my man so literally no one cares,
"I think if we look at f2p structure, sound design, balance and game design, dota is closer to a 10/10 than league",
shit opinion lmao,
bloodborne and fallout: new vegas are perfect games.,
"I think one of the only fps multiplayer games that deserves a 10/10 is Titanfall 2. The campaign alone is incredible, and the multiplayer gameplay is some of the most fun ive ever had in a multiplayer game.",
"How you guys about fallout new vagas, it’s still one of the most iconic fallouts to this day in my opinion",
"I think 2 games i’d give a 10/10 are NieR: Automata and OMORI. Both have really beautiful stories and great music. The gameplay in NieR: Automata was phenomenal and although I think the gameplay in OMORI wasn’t as great, it still felt fun the whole way through.",
Love to see the hollow knight on the 10/10,
FF Tactics anyone?,
"I think Kid Icarus Uprising ... *miiiiight* be a 10/10. It's not perfect - the story is fun but a tough look from a serious perspective, and the sprint mechanic is the main thing that might stop it.

But the characters are so lively, the gameplay so fun and unique, the story so enjoyable yet compelling. I dunno, I just think it's neat.

Also shoutout to Neon White, which is a 10/10 to the right person but I've never played.",
I'm barely two minutes into this video and malding over this half life take. How dare you sir.,
"The HL2 pistol sound is goated, you're just deafened by the glizzies in your ears.",
Monster hunter generations ultimate and hollow knight are a 10/10 for me,
"Undertale imo is the best storybased rpg game, the story, the gameplay and the fucking soundtrack are all so sick",
Atrioc I hope to god you don’t read ur comments but on the off chance you read this you should play Rain World,
"Eh Minecraft has been so mismanaged and poorly supported I can't say it's a 10/10, sure I still think the game is great but it feels like there is a huge void between what the game is and what the game feasibly could have been with more comprehensive updates. I mean sometimes we as a community would go years waiting only to get an update that is exclusively different coloured blocks. Or they do that bullshit where they make us vote between two mobs, and I'm sitting there being like ""you're a billion dollar company, make both the glowing squid and the yellow cow"". It doesn't help that I look at games in the genres Minecraft helped inspire and they'll have single updates with more content than every Minecraft update combined, the likes of Terraria, stardew valley and factorio have shown up how comprehensively a game can be updated and improved and so seeing the route Minecraft took is disappointing",
the only perfect 10 in my mind is overwatch 2,
Any of the batman arkham series is a 10,
"Majora's Mask is the perfect game in my opinion, and is a lesson in how rich a game can feel when huge effort goes into developing the story through side characters",
trackmania ez 10/10. you dont even need explanation why,
"I can’t with Atriocs take on Skyrim, Skyrim was breath of the wild before breath of the wild",
"Rocket league is an easy 10/10. New competitively viable mechanics are still being discovered, it still has a massive and constant player base, and it offers a fun/unique experience to everybody no matter what level of skill you have.

P.S. game is unplayable between 1500 and 2000 mmr be aware",
"I think minecraft is great but it lacks polish. And with inventory being what it is minecraft is currently unplayable without mods. I think 10/10 is fair because of its legacy but minecraft is still an unfinished game.

People compare terraria to minecraft but in the level of polish terraria is lightyears ahead of minecraft. Terraria is an easy 10, minecraft only gets it because of its impact on gaming.",
Half Life Alyx. I have never had more fun in my life.,
"""If it came out today, it woudn't be considered a 10/10"" is a pretty weak argument. The context of when, how and why something was created is a huge part of why it's considered relevant. We could build hundreds of pyramids, stone henges and great walls if we really wanted to, but they wouldn't be worth anything now.",
Unreal Tournament,
Red Dead Redemption 2!,
"I'm going to leave this here. Dishonored 1&2, Metro Series, The Final Station, Far Cry 3&5, Deus Ex Mankind Divided, Tomb Raider 2013",
garbage list. 1. Mass Effect 2. Fable 3. Halo 4. PUBG (when it had a playerbase) 5. Starcraft 6. Heroes of the storm,
Melee is not a perfect competitive game. If you need to mod your controller to play well how is that perfect. If it has 26 characters and can only play 8 how is that perfect. If you can fall through a stage and see that as normal how is that perfect.,
"wtf man now witcher 3
:(",
"It's hard to say it is slept on, but Disco Elysium is truly one of the greatest games ever made. No other game has gamified a narrative driven experience like it did. It is a once in a generation gaming experience.",
"I’m sure he brought it up on stream, but Witcher 3 absolutely is a perfect 10/10",
"Hot take…..
Geometry Dash is a 10/10 game",
Definitely very nostalgia biased but far cry 3 and ratchet and clank: “a crack in time” are two amazing solo player games and probably the best two games I’ve played.,
"It takes a lot for me to replay games but Terraria has always scratched that itch for me. Theres just so much content, satisfying gameplay, and amazing music. My personal favorite is all the sprite details which add so much to the already incredible atmosphere",
Halo Reach was my childhood,
All i'm saying is Card Shark is a pretty solid game if anyone wants to try a new game,
Monster Hunter World is by far one of the best experience's ive had in gaming.  I could play it a dozen times over with different weapons and still never  be bored.,
The edit with the dream stan removing atrioc from the dni list is fucking hilarious,
"Goron mask, the Goron mask is what makes Majora's Mask better.",
Making a post everyday until Atrioc plays Furi - Day 1,
Hades a fuckin 10? but not half life?? hes gone insane,
Terraria is the best coop game ever made (in my mind) 10/10,
"i'm wack my 10/10 games are black ops 2, rock band 3 and skate 3 lmao",
I would add Bloons td6,
"I don’t know how we don’t have NBA 2K17 on this, get better Brandon.",
"Bastion is a 10/10 for me for the story alone. I've played countless times and never felt like I picked the right ending, it's the kind of thing that sticks with you.",
"no no no, half life 2 had some of the best gun sounds of all time... guns arent supposed to sound like a dubstep bass drop, its the concussive feel the sound makes that makes a satisfying gun sound",
"Dwarf Fortress, Mario 64, Hollow Knight

Edit: Hit them on the spot",
"Mario Kart 64 is the perfect game. The music, the gameplay, the tracks are all top tier. My brother and I have played it consistently for 15 years. I still believe it's the best Mario Kart. It's a game everyone can get into.",
I am very sad he didn't put terraria in the list,
sometimes when i watch chat i also think im in chat but its all just s simulation.,
Did he ever mention BoTW?,
Does he ever realize the hl2 pistol is suppressed?,
I know you probably don't have a lot of experience with it but as far as competitive multiplayer games go Rocket League is absolutely a 10/10,
I was getting kinda worried 6 or 7 minutes into this video without the ocarina of time mention. He solved it though. Undisputed GOAT.,
Gives melee a 10 but no mention of 3rd stike or any good fighting games,
"Not only did HL2 have bad gun sounds, it had a limited and basic selection of weapons.",
"DOOM 2016 and God of War 2018 are 10/10 or very close to it.

DOOM Eternal's game-play does make 2016's game-play feel worse, but there are just some aesthetic things that make 2016 the better game in my opinion. The difference between finding a weapon in the world and having a little cinematic as you pick it up, and finding a floating green hologram of a weapon to grab it is so massive. Eternal's weapon pick-ups just feel lazy in comparison. Dashes, swinging, and the meat-hook in Eternal make the game-play so much faster though. I think both are a 9 or 9.5/10, but if you could have Eternal's game-play with some aesthetic things from 2016, you would absolutely have a 10/10 game.

God of War's camera blew my mind and ruined a lot of similar RPG games for me. I played through God of War and then started to play Horizon Zero Dawn, but going from the seamless cut-scene to game-play cam of God of War to the comparatively jarring cuts as you start conversations or interact with anything in Zero Dawn felt so bad and I just couldn't finish it because of that. Action cut-scenes are phenomenal and look amazing, game-play is fun enough and challenging enough at higher difficulties to keep me engaged, and the game just overall looks, sounds, and feels amazing. Only thing I could complain about is the inventory and character upgrade system, but the camera alone added so much to the game, and I will always have very fond memories of playing the game for hours on end in my college dorm while slurping down root bear floats. Definitely 9.5/10 if not 10/10.",
"I'm willing to say that hl2 is overrated, but big A's gun sound take is abysmal",
woah,
"People being weirdly defensive for HL2 probably haven’t touched it in 20 years. Even as a kid I knew that shit wasn’t a 10, because everyone was playing Halo and having a 10/10 time.

The gravity gun was remarkably fun though.",
so only the games he likes?!,
"The lack of Metal Gear Solid mentions is worrying Big A, sort it out, otherwise I'll have to do nothing in retaliation",
"You'd think after 3.6 million years of life, Brandon ""Glizzy Hands"" Ewing would learn not to play with sharp objects.",
Overwatch Clueless,
I was waiting for the video he was reacting to to start for a whole 10 minutes,
Kinda weird no one’s talking about DK64 🤨,
"What a load of cap, I played HL2 first time in 2017 and I replay that god damn game every single year. bUt tha PisTol SoUndS BaD WAA",
"feel like its the most basic gamer take to say ""sound can make a game"" like bro majority of game soundtracks you are never going to go back to again. For me, (and I know im not alone) sound design can be a very forgotten part of game design.",
we’ll never know what he was gonna say about atrioc racing…… goddamn you thumbtack!,
the thumbtack was retribution for hl2,
Has he heard of Celeste?,
The chat got the worst takes the whole video,
The only two 10/10s I would add would be banjo and ori,
Katana zero is a perfect game,
"I really dont see Ocarina of Time still being 10/10 nowadays, but back in the day sure but today, theres so much left wanting imo, but hey everyone is different",
"Pokémon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Darkness is easily a 10/10. Incredibly deep and moving story, gorgeous art, great quest system, top tier BGM, and more.",
Can't believe I don't see any mention of the masterpiece that is Chrono Trigger.,
Thumbtack definitely a 10/10 for even the glizzmaster to recognize playing with it,
paper mario 10/10,
I can't believe Atrioc almost died.,
honestly how could you forget about just dance and just dance 2. both masterpeices and beyond their time,
"10/10 games
Multiplayer 
3rd strike
Ggxx accent core +r

Dark souls 3 and dlcs
Bloodborne

Monser hunter world and 4U
Sekiro

Honorable mentions: 
Mirror s edge 1
Skyrim and morrowind
Halo infinite
Dark souls 1",
I'd also put Tetris among the list of games that are legit perfect.,
Atrioc won't play Celeste because he fears the grind,
No silent hill 2?,
"I havent played a lot of games but Celeste and Hollow Knight are probably my favorite. The gameplay, music and difficulty is just perfect for me.",
Will there be a poppathon video?,
Hear me out…. Rocket league. Such a basic game but to master the mechanics can take hundreds to thousands of hours.,
"Half life 2 is a masterpiece, great sound design. IDK what you are talking about. The first two guns you get sound eh???? Yeah what about the crossbow? The THUNK? The guns you use most sound great.",
Broooo im missing Witcher 3,
"For me, Legend of Zelda Ocarina of Time is a 10/10 for me personally. Prolly my favorite game of all time",
"Everyone brings up Skyrim but to me Oblivion and Fallout: NV were both better imo and the longer I've played video games the more I wish I could play them for the first time again especially Fallout. 

There's never been a game that captivated me like those games did. I still have like 3 maxed out characters in Oblivion on a couple hard drives somewhere in my house. 

Thinking about playing Fallout again for the first time genuinely gives me an emotional response.",
"There's NO WAY Minecraft is not a 10/10. 
On a personal level, the sheer amount of time I have sunk into the game while still finding it fresh is unbelievable. 
The insane level of player-generated content makes it transcend the bounds of the base game imo, it takes to a level that no other game has achieved. 
And then of course you have to consider its unparalleled impact and influence it has as the best selling game of all time. Every open world, sandbox, rpg, or build-focused game will find itself drawing from and comparing itself to Minecraft in some way shape or form.

Easy 10/10 in my books",
ZINJO SWEEP,
"I don't think it's perfect but for me, Megaman Legends is a 10/10 game. The transition to 3D for Megaman had a lot of clever design decisions, graphically it looked great for its time, the amount of pseudo open world things and unique ways to play were so ahead of its time, the characters and story while nothing groundbreaking was all really charming and iconic, I can go on and on honestly.",
Imagine forgetting god of war,
"Bro, the gun sounds were coming in Half Life 3😩",
doom eternal is an easy 10/10 for me but maybe its just obsession speaking since i have 800 hours in the single player,
"The problem with kotor is you can’t play it on a modern pc without making file adjustments and modding, but 2 Star Wars games that are 10/10 in my mind are fallen order, and skywalker saga overtakes the complete saga just cause it’s basically Complete saga remaster.",
Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance not even for the memes is for real probably the most pure fun game i've played,
"My guy forgot to mention some big games like subnautica, Jedi fallen order, terraria.",
:),
Witcher 3 and God of War 4,
"Tetris Effect is a 10 out of 10 game for me. They somehow made Tetris better, way more beautiful and accompanied by awesome soundtracks. Plus it had one of the best trailers of all time",
Chrono Trigger is for sure 10/10. One of the best games I've played.,
"MGS3, SM64 and Majoras Mask/Ocarina of Time and Fable 1/2",
"Outer wilds is my favorite game and is one of the most perfect games I’ve played. For someone who values sound in a game so much, I couldn’t Recommend a game enough",
"I played Mario 64 for the first time in my life 2 years ago on a mobile screen using touch controls , still loved it. No game (maybe other Marios do idk) handles as smoothly in 3d .

Same with ocarina of time. Haven't played majora's mask , probably a better game given it built upon ocarina of time but still ocarina of time is an easy 10/10 for me",
I think Old School Runescape is a 10/10 there has been no other game that had completely encapsulated an entire grade at my school and even to this day so many people play it.,
Outer Wilds along with its DLC has to be my definitive 10/10. No game I’ve played has managed to match the exploration and discovery of Outer Wilds. Just the concept of the game alone is so intriguing. And it’s all accompanied by a stellar soundtrack.,
"Portal 2 and Hollow Knight are truly the only 10/10 games I've ever played. I have other games that I've had as much fun in, like Minecraft, Cuphead, and Celeste, but man. Those games are just perfect back to front. Literally masterpieces.",
I swear to god if Hitman isn't in this list I am going to dislike this Video!,
Titanfall 2 ez,
Mario 64 is hot trash,
"csgo 10/10

All Metal Gear games aside from survive 10/10,
"It's tough to criticize the list cause it's clearly an opinion but all I'm gonna say is I think the criteria could be better standardized. Minecraft is a 10 because... I'm not sure? Melee is a 10 because it has a competitive scene and sounds good? I think I want a clearer distinction cause my list is so different though, so idk.",
"For me the metro series has some of the best environmental noises and music, all in all a great game series",
"God of War ps4 is an almost perfect game and I will die on that hill

You need to play Ori and the Blind Forest,
"Can’t believe my man is disrespecting Knack by not including him on this list, disgraceful",
"Halo 2 is not a 10/10 imo. I think Halo CE holds up more than Halo 2. There’s a lot that’s great with Halo 2, but i for me CE hooks me more and keeps me interested me with the gameplay.",
Pretty solid takes. I would think anyone who has put any substantial amount of times into league would also be pained to consider it a 10/10.,
How the fuck did nobody mention The Witcher 3. (Biased opinion tbh but still how?),
"you know what's an interesting game that most people probably won't think of that i would say is 10/10? chess, like if you really thinkabout what's the greatest game of all time, it's chess like's it's not even debateble it's chess",
Paunch????? 🙄🙄🙄 Omg CC fucked it again,
Falls guys fell so short in a time where they should have pushed a bunch of random ideas out. Make a create lobby option and or server list so ya can join lobbies in prep off peoples community stuff,

I rest my case",
"Man, is it bad I'd say Grand Theft Auto San Andreas. 😂",
"big A starting off the vid slandering hl2 was a bad idea, i clicked off lol who knows what nonsense was in the rest of the vid",

"I'm surprised you aren't a bigger fan of older RPG's with that singular focus mindset you have but, maybe you just need more stimulating or proactive gameplay like some of the games you had in your list. Or that you didn't have more platformers because of how pure gameplay and skill based they can be.

I haven't played them recently because of my job being all consuming but, Chrono Trigger and Paper Mario 2 have the most hours // playthroughs between anything else I have played.",
bro left guitar hero 3 off the list,
Windwaker,
"I’d say Mario Galaxy 1&2, Uncharted 4 and maybe spider-man 2018 are 10/10s",
but wut about fortnite guys,
Yoooo atrioc as a YouTube frog fairly new viewer I gotta say you gotta post more,
Did nobody mention BOTW???,
chess 10/10,
team fortress 2 is the goat game,
Big A went too far with that thumbtack jumpscare,
"Stardew Valley and Terraria are absolutely 10/10 games. I could replay both of them forever without ever modding them and still find enjoyment in them. I wasn't super receptive to Stardew Valley at first, but I've been playing it a ton on my Switch and I can easily lose track of time and just play it for like 10 hours straight.",
shoutout guy in chat who said littlebigplanet,
he really said mario 64 looks good but thinks ds3 looks bad wtf lmao,
Doom wasn't even mentioned :'),
I don't get why in this video they cut out the 10 minute rant on how atrioc racing was the perfect game and the only game ever to get 11/10,
"10 out of 10
Games for my opinion is Binding of Issac, Fallout New Vegas and Dark Souls 1",
"Atrioc shits on Half Life 2 just to give SM64 a 10/10. Man he really is going senile lol.

But no, it does NOT hold up well at all. That’s like saying Ocarina of Time holds up. Neither of them do, they are the Atari games of 3D platformers: primitive, inaccessible, and jank as hell. I can respect what they meant to people and what they did for gaming as a whole, but I can’t even play them because they have genuinely horrendous controls.",
No one mentioned New Vegas?,
if minecraft is not a 10/10 for you im sorry you either never had it or never had good friends to play with cause you literally make your own fun you make your own experience so if you didnt like it you didnt like your 1 playthrough or the people you played with and im sorry cause minecraft is great and im not even a zoomer,
Everyone forgets what year half life 2 came out in and it’s 2004 which is actually mind blowing to imagine how good the game looks and plays for its time,
Cuphead and hades are my only 10/10s this decade tbh. a handful of 9s that are close though,
"Personally, I’d also give Return of the Obra Dinn, Papers Please, The Stanley Parable, God Of War, Outer Wilds, Control, Disco Elysium, S.W.A.T 4, This is the Police & RDR2 a 10/10",

"Two games i think deserve 10/10s are Psychonauts and Katamari Damacy Reroll.

Pyschonauts imo is the best 3d platformer i’ve ever played. The world it takes place in is unique and interesting: A summer camp for kids with psychic abilities. The characters are funny and likable, the art style is reminiscent of something from older cartoon network or nickelodeon, and the writing is great. Oh and the level design. The level design is the most interesting i’ve ever seen, with each level taking place in a different characters mind. There’s a level where you’re giant and go through a city, there’s one where your in a neon mexican culture inspired town, one where you’re in a mentally unstable person’s trippy brain. It’s great, you should play it atrioc i think you would like it.

Katamari Damacy is also great with its charm, level design, and music. The mechanic of rolling around a ball procedurally picking up larger and larger items is just fun. The controls are a little iffy and bizzare but i think that’s part of the charm.",
"Halo Reach should be considered an absolute masterpiece. The campaign is an absolute high point in the halo series, even when compared to Halos 2 and 3.",
"No undertale? Crazy. 

I guess it might not be his cup of tea tho",
"Team fortress 2 should definitely be a contender for the 10/10 list. If the bot problem we’re fixed (and valve fixed some of the tiny bugs), then you would be left with one of the highest skill, most fun, and unique games ever! I’ve sunk thousands of hours into it and haven’t even seen all there is to see! An amazing community workshop with limitless possibilities, a potential for a competitive scene, amazing gameplay for all types of players; it is truly a game to behold",
What about chess it should the test of time,
OW would have been a 10/10 if they gave it the support it needed to survive,
Outer wilds feels underrated,
The entire Donkey Kong Country series on SNES is a 10/10 for me. Perfect platformers with perfect music and Graphics that hold up to this day,
"I played RE4 for the first time a few weeks ago and I've got to say I don't really get it, the game just felt like a huge mess, some of the boss fights were ok but the game only really felt enjoyable when you're fighting off hordes of villagers, 

I feel like it was popular because nothing else played like it but it has not aged well.",
"I refuse to receive that portal 2 is so good. like imagine pitching that game prior to it's release - ok so you play as a plain as looking robot, tackling very simple puzzles in grey, unimaginative rooms - oh and there's little to no story and it ends rather quickly too.",
"this is gonna be corny but i think Undertale is a 10/10 for me. ignoring all the toby fox fuckery with gaster and the deltarune connections, on its own undertale is just so damn good. it changed what you could do with rpg mechanics, gave you an interesting story, a set goal, and then subverted that same goal all while keeping it interesting and fun. it has humor and style that legitimately anyone could enjoy whether you're a kid or an adult and (while i'm biased because of how nostalgic i am towards it) it jus tsticks to you how good it is. every character was done so damn well (even the little NPCs you only see once in an area) and feels really timeless. ive replayed it so much and ive managed to find new things every time",
Ocarina of Time is a masterpiece for sure.,
"I'm so glad he said that about HL2, been saying this for years. 6 or 7/10 game at most. HL1 is probably a 9 though",
both ori games are ten out of ten,
"I really wish Megaman Legends got more love during the ps1/n64 era. Is it a 10/10, no probably not. But it had a great mixture of charm, story, and rpg elements.",
didnt mention undertale,
Literally consistently played minecraft for 9 years and watched content for 11 years. I’m 20 years old now and still the game holds up,
"If a perfect game is a game that does everything it set out to do, Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare is that. Perfect linear fps campaign with the best missions in the series. Every single FPS game that has come out since has replicated the standard that Cod 4 set for multiplayer games.",
"My list of 10/10s (off the top of my head) are
Minecraft
Celeste
Hollow Knight
Super Mario World
Mario 64
Mario Galaxy 2
Mario Odyssey
Smash Melee
Smash Ultimate
Portal 2
TLOZ: ALTTP
TLOZ: Ocarina of Time
TLOZ: Majora's Mask
TLOZ: Windwaker
TLOZ: BOTW
Outer Wilds
Journey
the original Plants vs Zombies
Mario Kart 7

Never played FromSoft games, Halo, Resident Evil, TLOS, 2D Sonic, or DK Country before,  but I probably will play all of these eventually, except maybe RE and TLOS.
I played Undertale but couldn't get into it as I was playing Hollow Knight at the time. I might return and give it another shot because the music is great.
I am a bit biased on Mario Kart 7 because I played soooo much of it. I have played a ton of all of these but the rest were actually masterpieces.
My most played game by far is minecraft but I have also put significant time into Celeste, Hollow Knight, all of the TLOZ games, Mario Odyssey, Mario Kart 7, and a bunch of others that did not quite make the list
Hades was great but I got bored after a while so it didn't make the list. Same for doom",
10 !,
Any Witcher 3 enjoyers?,
I will fight for Titanfall 2 and both KOTORs to be on this list. Mainly Titanfall 2 though because the KOTOR remake will hopefully be a 10/10.,
"Prey (2017) is a perfect 10, I feel it got critically overlooked.",
His Half Life 2 takes are cringe ngl. Combat is not the focus of HL2.,
Atrioc has a point with majoras mask but I could of never been the same without Oot,
"Final Fantasy has some minor gameplay flaws considering its age, but their storytelling is great making FF7 and FF9 both perfect for me. Persona 5 Royal is also flawless with the best sound design and character writing of any game. (Also the Zelda Series has so many classics.) Aside from JRPGs, God of War 2018 is amazing and worthy of a 10/10.",
imagine considering 10/10 for league when dota is around for like twice as long,
"dead space 2, bioshock infinite, and all metro games ez 10's tbh",
i would give undertale a 10/10 for how brilliant it is plus i still feel like it holds up today,
"Honestly it makes me sad not to see terraria mentioned in this video, It’s such a phenomenal game beloved by nearly everyone and has a massive fan base yet for some reason it always seems to be absent from discourse regarding the greatest games.",
My real 10/10 is pocket mirror and I will forever recommend it to anyone I meet,
"Celeste to me is a 10/10.  It has an amazing story and the way that each stage introduces really cool unique mechanics while remaining beatable is insane.  Then it offers plenty of hardcore content for players who love incredibly hard platformers, but even if you skip that because the game is to hard it is still amazing.",
"I have more hours in hades than I do any other game, so I smiled very big when he said it’s 10/10. Witcher 3 wild hunt (especially the 2 dlc) is also a 10/10",
But what about Roblox?,
I think the problem is a lot of people seem to confuse their favorite games with those that are truly 10/10,
can't believe he forgot bloons,
"Super Metroid for me is a 10/10. I struggle to play some older 2d platformers, but NO game has made me just want to pour thousands of hours into a speedrun like Super Metroid. The movement is probably the cleanest and most satisfying in a speedgame once mastered (in my opinion). The mechanics, ost, sound design, animations, and bosses are so ahead of their time. It’s also one of the games that is credited for speedrunning in general. Amazing amazing casual game, and speedgame. 

Super Mario Galaxy is probably a 10/10. That game looks phenomenal, has some of the most iconic music in any game, has super satisfying and easy to grasp movement, and has some of the greatest level design (imo). The only kinda meh thing is the bosses are kind mid. Even with that, I still believe it’s a 10/10. 

Terraria is a 10/10 too imo. So much replayability. The music, sprites, bosses, classes, biomes, devs, and creativity is insane. The modding scene makes the game 100x more expansive. It’s also one of the games that I think is even more fun when you play with a friend. Phenomenal game.",
Terraria ez,
how tf is this guy saying the hl2 ending is a let down? shit was dope af,
I’ve just started playing portal 2 for the first time and it is so good fr,
Hades is not a 10/10 because progression is gated behind random dialogue popping up. It's fucking infuriating making no progress in the story or unlocking the legendary aspects purely because the wrong speech bubble shows up.,
"I feel like calling Melee a 10/10 is crazy considering it’s obvious flaws. The community is very strong, but that’s not the same as the game being perfect or near it. I would struggle to even call the game a perfect competitive game considering the very clear lack of balance…

It’s good, but 10/10 is really biased. I would think 8 is more accurate.",
"HL2 had shitty but iconic gun sounds.  
Like i can still hear the muddy thumpin of the pulse rifle and i didn't even get much into half life",
Definitely go play outer wilds,
"All 10/10’s are valid, but my #1 above every single game ever made and ever will be made is Final Fantasy Tactics",
Outer Wilds is definitely the best game I’ve ever played and the DLC is close to if not just as good as the base game. Truly an amazing gaming experience that is unmatched by anything else I’ve played.,
"I think a lot of people dont get why minecraft is so great because they don't look at it through the lens of what it actually is, a SANDBOX game. And it's easily one of, if not the best sandbox games ever made. Seems like a simple game on the surface but really it's depth is endless if you keep digging in to it.",
Cod 4,
I agree completely with what you have in the 10/10 group but Imo I would add fallout: new Vegas,
"I think that the argument of HL2 not being a 10/10 due to its lackluster pistol and smg sounds is wild. Most of the sounds are phenomenal, baring those two (even though I do love the smg), the physics engine changed gaming forever. Without Half Life 2 showcasing the Source Engine, and what physics could be in a game, we would be in a different place now.  Not only that, but the NPCs interact amazingly, the story is great, and it just feels good to play still. I think you were way off base on this one",
"The take that Half life 2 isn't legendary but Mario 64 is, is completely jaded by being a streamer and knowing speedrunners. Mario 64 has not aged well and if you went back and played that remake that came out you know. Half-Life 2 is completely replayable, Ravenholm is probably one of the best FPS levels of all time",
To me Ori and the Blind Forest is an absolute 10/10,
"Persona 5, celeste, littlebigplanet, BOTW are 10s for me",
Celeste 10/10,
AoE2,
"I think the best way to do it is to go by genre because obviously someone who doesn’t like platformers still isn’t going to enjoy a “10/10” platformer and it’s hard to compare a turn based RPG with a 3D action game for example. From the games I’ve played I’d say Persona 5 Royal is a 10/10 for RPG’s, it might not be everyone’s cup of tea with the setting but in terms of game mechanics, music, characters/world building it’s the most polished RPG I’ve played (even though Xenoblade Chronicles is my favourite the sidequests are kinda ass so idk if I can give it an “objective” 10/10)
Also Smash Ultimate as a party fighter with the option of being competitive couldn’t be more perfect with its roster and stage selection, I guess the only thing that could be better is the singleplayer but I still think it’s a 10/10
Finally maybe Breath of the Wild as an open world game but that might be more of a 9/10 than a 10",
"Half life 2 was good but half life 1 is undeniably better, so half life 2 is definitely not a master piece. Half life 2 was a tech demo for the engine, which is a master piece.",

"Soma was a definite 10/10 for me. God what an incredible story game. So morbidly fascinating I still think about it at least once a week. The atmosphere was so amazing, the literal thousands of tons of pressure pushing in on you at every second you’re wandering around that sea base. You can actually almost feel it. It’s not super gameplay orientated though and probably that’s why it’s so overlooked.",
"Yakuza 0 is probably a rare videogame 10/10 for me. The story is loaded and very plot-heavy with a gradually developing spiderweb of events, the voice-acting is amazing, the action is fast and wonderfully violent, the music goes incredibly hard both in combat and in the famous karaoke minigame, the minigames are each unique from the other and are numerous, and the writing is funny, impactful, and overall fantastic, arguably some of the best in gaming for me, making the substories extremely worthwhile, especially since they somehow handle wacky bonkers humor extremely well alongside the serious, dramatic, and very differently toned story.
However, it is very long (though that wasn't a problem for me because of the story), can be clunky at times with using the menus and sometimes the camera, and is the most unfriendly game I have ever played for completionists. You will not have fun if you are playing for the achievements.
Thinking more about it, another 10/10 game for me is also The Pedestrian. I wish I dedicated the comment to that game now because I think there are literally zero flaws with it, but oh well, it doesn't take away from Yakuza 0.",
"Nintendo the real winner of the console wars, look at those 10's",
I'll throw Baldur's Gate 2 in the conversation.  It is one of the best RPGs of all time and it still holds up,
That half life 2 take has gotta be one of the biggest Atrioc L's,
GTA San Andreas has worse gun sounds than Half Life 2,
Bro I saw so many people say bloons td 6... seriously guys? I love that game but it's not even a 9 out of 10,
"The Metal Gear Solid series is a 10/10 imo, especially mgs4. Perfect soundtrack and gameplay",
Not sure if it’s a 10/10 but Witcher 3 is a great game,
"great editing, blink and you'll miss the ""based"" at 8:04",
"Those Half-Life 2 sounds really are iconic now, though. And undoubtedly the ambient noise in Half-Life 2 remains some of the best in video-games




EDIT: Also this whole comment section is sleeping madly on The Witcher 3. Yes, I know it's the most circle-jerked game out there, but goddamn is that a 10/10 game",
"I have to agree with Big A on his HL2 take. I absolutely loved HL1 when I first decided to play it in 2017, and started the sequel right after. 

Idk if I even made it through half of HL2 before never touching it again. I just didn't find it as engaging as the first game.",
"""Survive one minute into the video with your sanity 2022 challenge""",

Don’t forget bloons😧,
"lmao as for league, i hate it personally, but been playing for around 10 years.

its a toxic game by design, it's never gonna be healthy, balanced, or a fun game. ever


but still, having said that, nobody can say it's a bad game. mechanics are fleshed out, movement is smooth, animations are crispy, nothing really feels clunky (at least for long), and in general comparing to other mobas, it's one of the best in terms of playing experience (specially comparing to the pain that is playing dota 2 lmao).
on the other hand, it's definitely not a 10/10 game. huge solo queue / pro play discrepancies which fucks the whole game's balance, whole classes being useless, broken champs being used in not the intended lanes, and just in general the gold mechanic is always gonna make league a not competitive game when it comes to soloing",
"Play HL2 again, no balls",
Please play god of war bro,
How did no one mention Pokemon Red/Blue/Yellow?!,
I am being 100% serious: The Lego Star Wars Complete Saga is a perfect 10/10,
"I know everyone who plays Outer Wilds loves it, a potential 10/10 game?",
I’d personally disagree on the hollow knight being better than any other Metroidvania it’s a good metroidvania but I think people overrate it I much prefer a game like blasphemous or Metroid dread as I find the gameplay experience and fights more fun,
"I actually love the sound of the pistol in HL2. One of my favorite gun sounds from any game. POP POP POP. It just sounded so different from what I was used to at the time and kinda still hits different. Half-life 2 has always been one of my all-time favorites, but the original, and especially the Black Mesa remake are goated. Definitely agree with Sekiro and Hades. Some God of War and Resident Evil titles would be on my list as well.",
"“OOT made every PS1 RPG look like shit”

Ngl almost every zelda game is close to a 9 or 10 especially breath of the wild given how good it is and just how many players it introduced to other zelda games,
"Doom 1993 is my 10/10, amazingly fun to this day. I really enjoy Fallout NV for the writing and atmosphere, I'm addicted to the feeling of playing through the Mojave, so it's subjectively 10/10, but objectively it has technical issues.",
"HL2: Episode 1&2 more so than HL2 itself.
Homeworld, now that's where it's at",
"I definitely think OoT is a 10. Where there are better games than OoT, I genuinely can't think of a single thing about the entire game that I actually dislike, or even think isn't good. It's literally just perfect",
For me my two ten out of ten are most probably breath of the wild and minecraft. Dark souls 1 is almost perfect but blighttown and the camera lower it to like 9/10.,
"Halo Reaches campaign is really good IMO,  My favorite memories from Console days are Halo Reach and Black ops 2 both in my opinion are Peak video games though modern warfare(2019) really showed me what new generation of games could look like.",
"Hollow Knight, Undertale, and Celeste are the first that come to mind when I think of 10/10 games",
"GTA 5 is definitely a 10/10 in my book. I don't really count GTA Online as part of GTA 5 itself, so that probably plays into it. I just think that the sheer scope, beauty, and story of GTA 5 makes it a definitive 10/10.",
RED DEAD REDEMPTION MAN COME ON,
I actually agree with this list pretty much is very similar to mine.,
Kinda crazy how we did not see smite on this because it is the most fun moba and not toxic whatsoever 😁.,
Catrio?,
"Many people unfortunately leave it at one playthrough despite the game out right telling them not to, but I'm fully convinced NieR: Automata is the greatest game ever made for a multitude of reasons.

Combat is smooth and satisfying, the pinnacle of Platinum Games' formula. Heavy weapons are weighty, light weapons are floaty, and everything just fits so perfectly.

The story is emotional and engaging, keeping its somber tone throughout while excellently injecting some elements of humor and kindness to keep it from being a complete downer throughout. The several messages it conveys to the player are easy to understand, allowing the average player to engage with it, while deep enough to encourage a deeper discussion with it.

The music, it's stand-out feature to many, is absolutely beautiful, the second best OST ever made for a video game, only being narrowly beaten out by its predecessor, NieR.

Although it doesn't have the sharpest graphics, the vistas it creates and how they're presented to the player is simply amazing. Encountering the Amusment Park for the first time, running through the abandoned city with the oddly melancholic music accompanying you, and the end credits scene are all breathtaking experiences.

It isn't a perfect game, but I think it's the best ever made, and thus, a 10/10.",
"I saw a lot of rocket league in the chat, and I think out of online multiplayer games if you were to give one a 10/10 that would probably be it. Gameplay is totally great, the sound design is pretty awesome and the endless customization is insane.",

If you haven't played it (or, y'know, heard of it) I highly recommend giving it a try. I believe you can still get it for free under the name ""Ur-Quan Masters.""",

Red Dead Redemption 2 is definately up there.,

"Have to disagree, Half Life 2, 10/10",
"I cant imagine not having CS:GO on this list. CS:GO is a perfect shooter game. 100% skill based, you cant buy a skin or item that makes you better or gives you any advantage. There's nothing so OP that it cant be used in competitive play. It's a game that came out in 2012 and is still relevant 10 years later, with massive prize pools in esports. It is a pure test of your aiming skill, which is hard to come by nowadays. I have way too many hours on CS, so I may be a tad biased, but besides Halo 3 and Minecraft, It may be the best game ever made. (Coming from the prospective of a massive FPS fan)",
Disco elysium easily 10/10,

Assassins creed 1 - revelations,
"Celeste is a 10/10 hands down. Its pixel animation, soundtrack, gameplay physics, game mechanics, story, all immaculate.

Hollow knight is a 9.9/10 for me. The game is fantastic, i only wish some of the areas of the game felt more varied, like the forgotten crossroads, ancient basin and kingdoms edge feel very similar (though still great and fleshed out).

Undertale is a hard one for me, because the characters and story is a 20/10, and the soundtrack slaps. My only gripe with the game is the battle system, which (unlike deltarune) is slightly repetitive, but the interactions with those characters during fights is still great. I think it still has to be a 10/10. 

God of war (new one, cuz i havent played the originals), smash bros melee, minecraft, super mario 64, omori, deltarune (so far) are all also 10/10s for me.
Also, fortnite in its prime was 10/10, but overall it falls below that.
Finally, deaths door (a game i assume not many have heard of) is a contender for 10/10. Its artstyle and music is great, with great combat mechanics and unique POI’s. Feel like a few aspects of it may draw it back tho.
Theres many other 10/10 games out there, i just havent played them yet.",

There's shit in that game that I would say are 100x cooler than anywhere the new SW movies go.

God of War 2018 is probably my favorite game of all time. It's the first game I ever strived to 100% because the world was so big and I loved how every location in the game was deep and rich with lore regarding norse mythology.

The combat is the most fluid combat I have ever played in a videogame. When you get it down it feels like a dance. It has really good replayability and very good endgame content. Sword Saint Isshin and Inner Owl are some of the best bossfights in videogames. The only complaint I have ever had about the game is that the grab attacks are sometimes bs.",
Hollow knight for sure,
Hey big atrioc would you be interested in playing more RTS type games? I was just rewatching the backlog and the Age of Empires video was really fun to watch!,
Subnautica is easily a 10/10 game for me. I wish I could play it again completely blind.,
"Recently I think that Omori is a 10/10 for me. The art is so adorable and so horrifying at the same time, the soundtrack is full of bangers, and gameplay made so much sense with the characters and story. I never had a game give me such an emotional rollercoaster where I was even thinking about it in the middle of the night.",
Celeste?,
"Honestly gotta disagree on the Minecraft. It has some serious progression flaws, and tedium. I love minecraft, don't get me wrong, but there's definitely some shit parts of that game.",
The last of us is 10/10,
Binding of isaac rebirth,
freaking love Hades,
"My 10/10s are Pokémon Black/White 2, Enter the Gungeon, Titanfall 2, Minecraft, and Destiny 1/2 at points",
Titanfall 2 Campaign though?,
"hl2 isnt a 10 but portal2 is a 10??? either both are, or they are both nines.  pokemon red and blue are 10s, they literally just repackage that game every few years, people know it and people still buy it.",
How did you not mention Paper Mario and the Origami King. I am in shock and total disarray that you never even brought it up. You should be ashamed of yourself for your actions. Smh I thought you were better than this. 😔,
Wow u didn't even talk about MGS,
"For me, the only game I’d say is the closest game to perfection is Final Fantasy 9.

Top tier story, top tier music, top tier characters, probably the best ATB game I’ve played but ATB still kinda sucks, top tier top tier",
The only game I have in mind is Shadow of the Colossus,
"Imo a solid 11 for me are Xenogears and Xenoblade Definitive Edition (remaster), i could be hours here explaining why, but all im going to say is that those games present a narrative different from any other game i have ever played, just play it, especially now that Xenoblade 3 us coming to present the ending of the Perfect Works story",
Black Ops 2 has to be a 10/10 at least in multiplayer terms,
"Mass Effect 2 is a 10/10 I think. My personal favourite game is Vampire the Masquerade: Bloodlines, but there are enough design issues, even with the unofficial patch, that I cannot give it a 10/10 in good conscience. It gets carried so hard on atmosphere, though.",
2:08 someone in chat said Plants vs Zombies and they are correct,
This video definitely gets a 10/10 for the editing.,
"I'm sorry, but HL2 is 10/10. There is no debate here.",
"True 10/10’s imo are Final Fantasy X, Crysis, Left 4 Dead 1/2, Mass Effect 2, Mario 64, Bioshock, GTA 5, Skyrim and Halo 2/3. I could go on but this list would go on for a long time lol",
Mario Super Sluggers 10/10 nothing is better than playing baseball as Donkey Kong batting with a boxing glove,
I want to give pretty much every Xenoblade game a 10/10 (even the ones not in the main series like Xenogears and saga). I might be biased but they are some of the only games I have ever played that I could actually do another playthrough and even cried during the story in most of them.,
"I know this take has been overdone recently, but Titanfall 2 has to be one of the best feeling games I've ever played. It was like using herione for the first time and not being able to go back to meth.",
Paper Mario thousand year door will still forever have that place in my heart as the perfect turn based game,
fallout new vegas,
"I was blind but now I see, playing with thumbtacks was made for me",
"I have only rated 2 games 10/10. Celeste (despite Atriocs hate) and Ori and the will of the wisps
Edit: (and the cuphead DLC)",
Bloodborne. The only game that came easily to mind.,
"Pretty solid list, although I think that there is quite a few games missing, it’d take absolute ages to go through all of them. Also MM gang rise up. OOT is definitely a 10/10 but MM is such a different game with the same style. Everything feels relevant and polished and you always have that impending doom everywhere you go. Idk that game just makes you.. feel.",
"Nothing on this list but Atrio, calling it rn.",
Red Dead Redemption 2,
Think doom ethereal was/is a amazing game like around a 9/10 / 8/10.,
"Calling it rn, Big A thinks that Half Life 2 is a 10 out of 10!!!!",
Halo 3,
Its hard for me to give hitman a singular score bc the maps can range from amazing to haven,
"The only games I've rated 10/10 in the last few years are Hades, Elden Ring, Marvel's Spider-Man, Celeste, Hollow Knight, BOTW, and Shovel Knight TT.",
Mario 64 is pretty ugly. Spyro came out only 2 years later on the PlayStation which wasn’t as powerful and that game looks way nicer,
Cant believe rdr2 wasn’t even mentioned :(,
the differance between a 10 / 10 and a 5 / 10 is skill based matchmaking,
"When was the last time halo 2 stans played that campaign? Literally every levels is a ""Hold your ground"". Half the time, you're jumping around in circle waiting for them to spawn.",
"I got some of my own subjective 10/10s, most of these are gonna be on the newer side not gonna be in any order
1. Katana ZERO. I think this game might genuinely be perfect, it's like... just right. It has great action, a haunting story, and tons of replay value. Granted I didn't give it 100 hours or anything like that but for a game that can be beaten in 15 mins I gave it like 16 hours of my life just playing it for fun so that's gotta count for something
2. Rimworld. This game is dangerously close to being the best video game of all time the more I think about it, Rimworld is endlessly, genuinely endlessly replayable. I have like 300 hours and I've never beaten it, not that I really think it's meant to be beaten, this game is a story generator and damn is it a good story generator. Yes you can win, but I never really saw the goal mattering as much as how you get there and the stories you can tell about what you did and how you did it.
3. Pokemon black 2. Pokemon games are inherently flawed because of a million different reasons but this game? It's probably the best pokemon game out there I've replayed it to completion five times in my life and that's more than can be said about like every other game I've played.
4. Monster Hunter Portable 3rd. This game is my childhood game, this game is my perfect game, and if you asked me what my number 1 personal favorite game is it's this one. The newer MH games are phenomenal, but nothing ever comes close to this game. It's a game I am truly, genuinely in love with

As for some I think are close, but not quite there yet for one reason or another
1. Hollow Knight - It's almost there, but I just haven't beaten it yet. I cannot finish the last coliseum but nothing ever will match the feeling I got playing it for the first time, just wow. Losing to the coliseum of fools definitely has made me a lil salty tho gonna admit hahaha
2. Skullgirls - I'm gonna give this game kudos wherever, whenever, it needs it man. Also I just love the game
3. Crusader Kings 3 - Almost. It just needs more content to be 10/10
4. Stellaris - It doesn't need more content I just need to play it more, but I think strategy games like this just inherently can't be 10/10s because of how fast I burn out and can't finish them",
"Surely if we're talking about small, self-contained experiences that achieve exactly what they set out to do, we have to mention Journey. 10/10",
Pokémon?,
There is no objectively 10/10 game since to be a 10/10 game it would have to be completely perfect game and that’s impossible since everyone have different tastes,
"Subnautica: Abandon Ship, best Soundtrack change my mind.

Soundtrack: https://youtu.be/nf30qQzw7rk",
"Outer Wilds is easily a 10/10, and it's dlc is another 10/10. it would be awesome if Big A played it.",
has atrioc played outer wilds?,
"For me, Factorio, Celeste, Stardew, Baba is You, and Sonic Mania are 10/10s.",
"Borderlands 2, some of the Yakuza games and most of the Monster Hunter games are perfect 10s imo",
"Mario Odyssey, Ori 2, BOTW, Smash Ultimate, Cuphead, Mariokart 8",
"For JRPGs I'd say Paper Mario and the Thousand Year Door, Kingdom Hearts 2, Xenoblade Chronicles, and maybe Final Fantasy VII are the 10/10s that come to mind.",
Go play outer wilds don't look at spoilers. Best game ever made potentially minus a couple porbis,
"22 seconds in and we already have a horrible take, always delivering Big A",
Thumbtack 10/10?,
honestly kinda sad that Nier Automata wasent mentioned since it was probably the best game i had played till now,
Trash take A. 2004. Fresh source engine. If you dont consider it a 10/10 you didnt play it when it dropped. It made portal. Figure it out.,
"Someone said it in chat, but Spiderman 1&2 for PS4 were both amazing in every aspect. Sounds, beauty in the environment, amazing storyline and villains, stealth missions, side quests, cool skins, and most of all the satisfying swinging and fighting controls. That is a perfect game in my opinion

Every time I’ve ever played it my only complaint was that I wished it was longer",
Sonic adventure 2 battle?,
Star Wars Battlefront 2 (2005) is a 10 out of 10 to me. It is one of the only games that I can consistently go and do a 100% run of every few months,
"Puzzle - Portal 1 (duh)
Fighting - Melee (sorry fgc)
Sports - Rocket League (LOL)
Shooter - TF2
Strategy/City Builder - Dwarf Fortress
Platformer - Mario 64
Minecraft is a 10/10 too it doesnt have a category",
"Most recent game i might call a 10/10 was half life Alyx, the atmosphere in tbe half life universe was an amazing experience",
these are all literally 7s or 8s at best,
9/10 video,
The take on PS1 RPGs is pretty hot lol I'm sure FF7 fans would have something to say,
"There is one game that legend says is so rare, so pure, so divine, so mind breaking and world altering that it can only be played one time a year on a fair May night. That seems to be notably omitted here",
Minecraft is 10/10. I don't even like the game that much. You can create machines/builds far beyond the scope and imagination of the creators of the game. Infinite content/fun only limited by imagination.,
Mario Odyssey 10/10,
Warcraft 3 was a 10/10 game until they reforged it.,
Video about perfect 10's yet NO mention of red dead redemption 2? insanity,
Never owned anything Nintendo. I had to go to McDonald’s to play Super Mario 64 back when they had those video games in the play area 😂,
"The tetris series of games atleast needs to be in this conversation, Tetris is the only series of games in the world where i can pick up practically any version of it and just play for hours without getting bored. The core gameplay is amazing and extremely easy so much so that anyone can play it, but at the same time the depth of the gameplay is still deep enough that you can play for hundreds of hours and still be getting better, you need to learn to play at speed, how the rotating system works, what random setups you can use to abuse said rotating system, what gets you the most points in what situation, all of that shit. As well as the music, the original tetris theme is probably one of my favourite video game themes, and then you have tetris effect which if you are gonna choose one game as a 10/10 for the tetris series it would have to be that, its got the zone power for a buit of extra gameplay that keeps it fresh if you have already played tetris a bunch, and thent he music and visuals are top-tier for any videogame.",
"i have no connection to half life at all. but hearing atrioc call half life 2 ""forgettable"" is so funny. its like the 1 game i hear everyone suck on lol",
the first game that came to mind is titan fall 2:) (campaign is amazing and multiplayer is still really fun),
hes forgetting bloons!!!,
i like nier automata,
I saw my boys in chat spreading the gospel of Outer Wilds,
Half life 2 is bad because of a minor pistol sound effect that isnt even that had 😎,
"Titanfall 2 10/10. absolutely goated, abandoned by EA",
Mgs 1,
"Persona 5 is a 10/10. The characters, the music, the style, the gameplay it's just perfect, it also invented jazz so that's a plus",
I think Breath Of The Wild is a solid like 8/10 or 9/10 I dont think its a 10/10 because I don't think it will hold up against more open world games that come out now that game developers know well done open world games work such as Elden Ring. Of course that's just my opinion,
"There's no way you can say minecraft is ahead of its time, it's just a bunch of blocks",
Bloodborne.,
"Like one guy said in chat, shadow of the colossus, is a perfect game, the sound, the scale, the lore, the graphics, the creatures, the immersion of feeling terrible for killing these ageless beautiful beasts but knowing you have to continue despite that they do nothing except be hunted and so they fight back. One of the greatest games ever",
Tony hawk pro skater 3 was always my favorite TH game and certainly a 10/10 from me,
an entire perfect game video without mentioning God of War is criminal,
"Castle Crashers has a humor of the early internet, fart jokes n all, but it's one of those games I happily replay with my friends again and again. Easy 10/10 pls Behemoth give us Castle Crashers 2",
ape escape 2 is a perfect ten.,
"I think it's totally fair to say that HL2 is not a 10/10 game, it was just really important for it's time and has a great plot.  That being said, I think Atrioc is doing to Minecraft what he complained about people doing to HL2.  I'm a huge Minecraft fan but the game is not and has at no point been 10/10, it's just had a lot of cultural impact and is a really impressive game.  The flaws of minecraft are kinda glaring and a lot of them will never get fixed at this point.  I think it's almost unfair to even include it in the list because Minecraft is so much more of a platform or game engine than an actual videogame itself.  The hoards of kids who play minecraft aren't playing vanilla survival, they're all playing on servers that are modded to hell to make it an entirely new game",
"I think we all know that atrioc thinks that BTD6 is also a 10/10, he was just too afraid to admit it",
"Titanfall 2 is the best fps game of the last 10 years.
The pvp is great, the movement is the best of its kind and the story is amazing, modern fps games cant even compete.",
Cyberpunk is truly one of the games of all time,
"Bro RE4 was a game I was thinking about from the start of the vid. Hoesntly, there were so many good games from that era. DMC3 was legit as well.",
I'm gonna say Ocarina and Majora's are FAR from being 10/10s. Like insanely far. My reasoning is perfectly explained if you watch Sequelitis - ZELDA: A Link to the Past vs. Ocarina of Time by Egoraptor. My opinion was not blindly shaped by this video. This video just perfectly reflects my exact feelings and thoughts about the game,
"Frog fractions 10/10 game, you could not change my mind",
Halo combat evolved OG perfect game,
"My top 5 games of all time and games I’d consider 9-10s would be uncharted 2, arkham city, elden ring, minecraft and bo2",
Titanfall 2 is perfect. I will take no other opinions.,
Celeste is a 10/10 tbh,
"in all honesty bloodborne is a 10/10 in every aspect. The story, lore, world, gameplay, bosses, music, sound design, graphics literally everything is perfect and holds up today",
I think castle crashers is a 10/10. The best side scroller ever made,
"i think outer wilds is up there with one of the greats exceptionally with the DLC. the sound, the mystery and the lore is awesome and the map is i think the best map of a game ever made",
katana zero for me perferct soundtrack and sound the lore and the story secrets sword secret boss etc u just don't get bored of it because the game forces you to think diffrently you just can brute force your way through and the dialouges with the therapist actually make a diffrence you can finish a stage with 2 options you can kill everyone or get out without killing anybody and the game isn't even that long its 4 hours for the first playthrough and if you want to get diffrent sword after you beat the game theres a tv that you can select diffrent stages so you don't start the game over and over again to get the secret swords and the secret boss. i love that game,
the question on everyone’s minds,
"Personally I’d have to go with dishonored, a decade old and holds up so fucking well. Great replay ability and great dlc. Sequel is good too but doesn’t scratch the itch the original does",
unsubbed for hl2 hate,
"Inscryption, the first time through, fucking love that game. The twists and turns, the fun game play, the fact they were basically forced to make it a rogueluke because of all the fun card stuff people wanted repeated, it's in my top 10. The charm is unmatched. Super biased but it's one of my favorite games I've ever played",
When you made the comments about league causing physical pain and the black tar heroin joke I cackled so god damn loud. Great video.,
pokémon emerald kinda 10/10 based and peepo,
release the dunkey cut >:(,
It takes two is a 10,
Gran Turismo,
If that thumbtack isnt an allegory for the league of legends experience I don't know what is...,
"I found Majoras Mask more fun but Ocarina of Time more of an adventure.

Edit: kotor was kinda meh",
"Shovel Knight, Botw, Pikmin 3 are 10s for me",
"I don’t know if it’s allowed but Minecraft with mods is 10/10, but vanilla isn’t…",
"Resident evil 4 Is one of my favorite games. I don't even mind buying it 8 times now. It feels so good, I love the characters. The world looks so good while also being grim. There's humor, horror, action, serious moments, stakes, whacky quick time events. Absolutely weird controls. And it all works",
phantom dust a 10/10,
"Axiom verge and Unepic, perhaps quake 1. Diablo 1 for sure, brood war.",
Deep rock galactic and terraria are both 10/10,
"Only games I give a 10/10 are Doom 1993, Resident Evil 2 (2019) Resident Evil 4, Danganronpa:Trigger Happy Havoc, Minecraft and probably Cuphead and fallout new Vegas",
Last of us 2 10/10,
Conker's Bad Fur Day for N64 is an easy 10/10,
Witcher 3,
"I think I would consider StarCraft 2 a 10/10 such a great game with such a great story, and it even gets sprinkled with some of the best ingame cinematics I’ve ever seen. Every time I play an rts I think to myself I wish I was playing StarCraft.. it seems like StarCraft was so good it killed its own genre",
no one ever talks about undertale,
Subnautica has some of the best sound design ever.,
Ori and the blind forest was a banger,
"""Atrioc Racing 2"" will be an instant 10/10 once it releases",
7:51 Rest in peace technoblade,
Half life 2 is a 10 out of 10,
"Here's my list of ""Perfect"" games:

- Dark Souls 1 if it was only the first half
- Bloodborne if it was 60fps
- BOTW, minus the dungeons, story, bosses, and required objectives
- Katamari Damacy",
RDR2 is 10/10,
"My mother will always be a 10 in my heart, Yes Atrioc!",
I’d say my 10/10 is outer wilds,
"atrioc's Gamer Takes are based 

skyrim? mid. half life 2? mid. sekiro? 10/10. this guy knows what hes talking about",
"I saw it in a chat a couple times, but Chrono Trigger is an absolute masterpiece",
Bro alien isolation,
"No sekiro, but outer is definitely ou there",
castle crashers and battleblock theater !!!,
"Can anyone tell me how black ops 2 isn’t a 10/10? Addictive and rewarding intuitive Multiplayer, a fucking fuck exiting and engaging campaign, and the best zombies game mode created since then. Has to be.",
Paper Mario is 10/10,
"celeste, hollow knight, and outer wilds might be my only 10/10 games… Metroid dread is pretty damn close too but I haven’t finished it quite yet but it’s one of the most polished Nintendo games I’ve played in recent memory for today’s standards.",
the console wars is the one war Big A actually served in,
Realm Royale is a perfect 10/10,
How you gonna say you like tight short games then say hollow knight is a 10... That shit is the opposite of short and sweet.,
Mies leading thumbnail :(,
1HE GIVES HADES A 10/10 AND NOT SKYRIM this dude is off his rocker holy shit,
Pokemon Mystery Dungeon Explorers of Sky is also definitely a 10/10 game. The storytelling and pacing of that game is so amazing. Some sick plot-twists as well.,
Inside is a 10,
I think as far as RPGs go Dragon Age: Origins is a 10/10 and probably the best western RPG ever made. It doesn’t miss on any aspect of the genre and is innovative in a lot of ways games weren’t at the time. I think it gets forgotten because the sequel was a 2/10 and the third one was a 5-6/10,
Boomer take ngl,
In my opinion Minecraft can’t be a 10/10 because of how reliant it is on looking things up. Without google the game kinda blows,
"Out of all of the games I have ever played, nothing compares to Team Fortress 2 and Terraria, both of which deserve 10/10s.",
Breath of the wild but I don’t want a 10/10 I want the speed run competition between atrioc stanz and Ludwig. They have all worked on tech,
Imagine believing anything this man says after he stabs himself with a thumbtack he was playing with 💀,
yo Big A what is this video out of 10?,
"I'll die on this hill... sekiro is far from a 10/10. Compared to other souls like games the combat is repetitive, bosses are repetitive, the music is great for an hour then ur over it... no customization features compared to 90% of games. It's a good game but lackluster in the end",
cuphead,
based sm64 take,
Titanfall2 had always been the best FPS game for me. No other game has had that quality of gameplay and a banger campaign with it,
Good opinions and great vid ty zinjo,
The first dishonored game was def a 10/10 for me. Plus the story is even more relatable now since the pandemic started,
"I have hundreds of hours in minecraft, but I think I wouldn't rate it a 10. There just isn't ENOUGH. There's barely anything interesting to find through exploration. Terraria did it better, and I'd only barely rate terraria a 10. Minecraft's multiplayer is significantly better, but the lack of content is a major hurdle.",
Hey atrioc what does it take to get a like from you?,
"Forgot Paper Mario, classic mistake",
what?!?,
I was not ready for him stabbing himself,
I love the sound of falling onto a window in Manifold Garden. Satisfying and I went out of my way to do it repeatedly,
Fallout NV gotta be my GOAT game if i really had to pick,
